   Hello everyone, welcome back to Week 78 of Synthetic Challenge!! Thank you u/critzz123 and u/ezaroo1 for the great challenges! This week it's my turn to host the challenge and I'm going to try hosting more molecules for you to try, hope you'll enjoy!
   
   Too easy? Too hard? Let me know, I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!
   
   Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!
   
   **Rules**
   
   The challenge now contains three synthetic products labelled A, B, and C. Feel free to attempt as many products as you like and please label which you will be attempting in your submission.
   
   You can use any commercially available starting material for the synthetic pathway.
   
   Please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference the technique if it is novel. You do not have to solve the complete synthesis all in one go. If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have done and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution.
   
   You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or if it's too complex to explain in words.
   
   Please have a look at the other submissions and offer them some constructive feedback!

   [Structure of Product C](https://i.imgur.com/JUB2YeA.png)
   
   **BONUS**
   
   For this bonus structure, instead of proposing a synthetic pathway TO it, you will be using it as a Starting Material to make any product you want. Take however many steps you want as long as you start with this bonus compound in the first step! Let me know if you like this bonus challenge! Thanks!

15,"I was looking up if it would be possible to separate Oxygen from CO2 and I found something interesting(to me at least), so the following is an answer I found on physicsforums from 2007

""you could heat CO2 over a catalyst of iron doped zeolite and hydrogen to produce water and ethylene. A nonthermal plasma applied to ethylene will generate carbon soot and recover the hydrogen. Electrolysis of water gives back the extra hydrogen and produces oxygen. (Hey! I didn't say it was efficient.) It might be useful to someone on Mars who has endless power in the form of a nuclear reactor and plenty of CO2 but not so much oxygen.""

16,"test tubes are “matched” to achieve the same/similar path length between all test tubes when using a spectrophotometer.
I use the 1% rule and try to keep all the test tubes I used within 1% transmittance of each other.

how important is what i’m doing? like let’s say if your analyzing iron convent via spectrophotometer is it super important to have all test tubes within like 1% transmittance? or would like 5% of a transmittance range between all be fine too?

hope that makes sense

is there an easy/cheap way to create bunch of Ca2+ ions in destilled water? (i only want Ca2+ ions in the destilled water nothing else)

also the same for HCO3- ions?

I've searched and found out that tin is resistant to oxidation when exposed to air, but there are no specifics as to whether it oxidizes slower than copper when exposed to air.

1250,"I have recently acquired a .jdx file for an IR spectrum.  It looks great—on ChemDraw.  However, when I export it as a .pdf, it becomes very weird.  Zooming in, you can see kind of like squares of individual datapoints.  Which leads me to think that, somewhere within a .jdx file is extractable data, which perhaps I can obtain to make a better looking spectra than the .pdf I saved it as.  Would anyone happen to know how I might go about doing this?  Is this even the correct forum to ask?  Thanks anyway!",How would I go about extracting the raw data from a .jdx file?
