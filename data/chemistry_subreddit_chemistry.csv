Hello everyone, welcome back to Week 76 of Synthetic Challenge!! Hope you enjoy the return of a bit of inorganic chemistry! 

Please don't be scared to get things wrong and just have a go!

Too easy? Too hard? Let me know, I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!

Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!

**Rules**

The challenge now contains three synthetic products labelled A, B, and C. Feel free to attempt as many products as you like and please label which you will be attempting in your submission.

You can use any commercially available starting material for the synthetic pathway.

Please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference the technique if it is novel. You do not have to solve the complete synthesis all in one go. If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have done and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution.

You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or if it's too complex to explain in words.

Please have a look at the other submissions and offer them some constructive feedback!

[Structure of Product B](https://i.imgur.com/JMB4bYn.jpg)

[Structure of Product C](https://i.imgur.com/NRSjhU9.jpg)

**BONUS**

This BONUS molecule is for you to make any compound you would like given that the starting material is this molecule. This segment is designed so that you can practice proposing synthetic reactions to build molecule and others can pitch in to determine if the procedures are possible.

Instead of the traditional paradigm of target based synthesis, this is taking the creativity from that and you make whatever end product you desired. If you ever feel stuck with the main challenges A, B, and C, feel free to trying making a random molecule with this bonus and that may inspire some ideas for you or others.

**BONUS**

This BONUS molecule is for you to make any compound you would like given that the starting material is this molecule. This segment is designed so that you can practice proposing synthetic reactions to build molecule and others can pitch in to determine if the procedures are possible.

Instead of the traditional paradigm of target based synthesis, this is taking the creativity from that and you make whatever end product you desired. If you ever feel stuck with the main challenges A, B, and C, feel free to trying making a random molecule with this bonus and that may inspire some ideas for you or others.

Hello everyone, welcome back to Week 76 of Synthetic Challenge!! Hope you enjoy the return of a bit of inorganic chemistry! 

Please don't be scared to get things wrong and just have a go!

Too easy? Too hard? Let me know, I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!

Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!

**Rules**

The challenge now contains three synthetic products labelled A, B, and C. Feel free to attempt as many products as you like and please label which you will be attempting in your submission.

You can use any commercially available starting material for the synthetic pathway.

Please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference the technique if it is novel. You do not have to solve the complete synthesis all in one go. If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have done and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution.

You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or if it's too complex to explain in words.

Please have a look at the other submissions and offer them some constructive feedback!

[Structure of Product B](https://i.imgur.com/JMB4bYn.jpg)

[Structure of Product C](https://i.imgur.com/NRSjhU9.jpg)

**BONUS**

This BONUS molecule is for you to make any compound you would like given that the starting material is this molecule. This segment is designed so that you can practice proposing synthetic reactions to build molecule and others can pitch in to determine if the procedures are possible.

Instead of the traditional paradigm of target based synthesis, this is taking the creativity from that and you make whatever end product you desired. If you ever feel stuck with the main challenges A, B, and C, feel free to trying making a random molecule with this bonus and that may inspire some ideas for you or others.

Hello everyone, welcome back to Week 76 of Synthetic Challenge!! Hope you enjoy the return of a bit of inorganic chemistry! 

Please don't be scared to get things wrong and just have a go!

Too easy? Too hard? Let me know, I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!

Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!

**Rules**

The challenge now contains three synthetic products labelled A, B, and C. Feel free to attempt as many products as you like and please label which you will be attempting in your submission.

You can use any commercially available starting material for the synthetic pathway.

Please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference the technique if it is novel. You do not have to solve the complete synthesis all in one go. If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have done and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution.

You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or if it's too complex to explain in words.

Please have a look at the other submissions and offer them some constructive feedback!

[Structure of Product B](https://i.imgur.com/JMB4bYn.jpg)

[Structure of Product C](https://i.imgur.com/NRSjhU9.jpg)

**BONUS**

This BONUS molecule is for you to make any compound you would like given that the starting material is this molecule. This segment is designed so that you can practice proposing synthetic reactions to build molecule and others can pitch in to determine if the procedures are possible.

Instead of the traditional paradigm of target based synthesis, this is taking the creativity from that and you make whatever end product you desired. If you ever feel stuck with the main challenges A, B, and C, feel free to trying making a random molecule with this bonus and that may inspire some ideas for you or others.

Hello everyone, welcome back to Week 76 of Synthetic Challenge!! Hope you enjoy the return of a bit of inorganic chemistry! 

Please don't be scared to get things wrong and just have a go!

Too easy? Too hard? Let me know, I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!

Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!

**Rules**

The challenge now contains three synthetic products labelled A, B, and C. Feel free to attempt as many products as you like and please label which you will be attempting in your submission.

You can use any commercially available starting material for the synthetic pathway.

Please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference the technique if it is novel. You do not have to solve the complete synthesis all in one go. If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have done and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution.

You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or if it's too complex to explain in words.

Please have a look at the other submissions and offer them some constructive feedback!

[Structure of Product B](https://i.imgur.com/JMB4bYn.jpg)

[Structure of Product C](https://i.imgur.com/NRSjhU9.jpg)

**BONUS**

This BONUS molecule is for you to make any compound you would like given that the starting material is this molecule. This segment is designed so that you can practice proposing synthetic reactions to build molecule and others can pitch in to determine if the procedures are possible.

Instead of the traditional paradigm of target based synthesis, this is taking the creativity from that and you make whatever end product you desired. If you ever feel stuck with the main challenges A, B, and C, feel free to trying making a random molecule with this bonus and that may inspire some ideas for you or others.

Hello everyone, welcome back to Week 76 of Synthetic Challenge!! Hope you enjoy the return of a bit of inorganic chemistry! 

Please don't be scared to get things wrong and just have a go!

Too easy? Too hard? Let me know, I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!

Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!

**Rules**

The challenge now contains three synthetic products labelled A, B, and C. Feel free to attempt as many products as you like and please label which you will be attempting in your submission.

You can use any commercially available starting material for the synthetic pathway.

Please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference the technique if it is novel. You do not have to solve the complete synthesis all in one go. If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have done and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution.

You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or if it's too complex to explain in words.

Please have a look at the other submissions and offer them some constructive feedback!

[Structure of Product B](https://i.imgur.com/JMB4bYn.jpg)

[Structure of Product C](https://i.imgur.com/NRSjhU9.jpg)

**BONUS**

This BONUS molecule is for you to make any compound you would like given that the starting material is this molecule. This segment is designed so that you can practice proposing synthetic reactions to build molecule and others can pitch in to determine if the procedures are possible.

Instead of the traditional paradigm of target based synthesis, this is taking the creativity from that and you make whatever end product you desired. If you ever feel stuck with the main challenges A, B, and C, feel free to trying making a random molecule with this bonus and that may inspire some ideas for you or others.

Hello everyone, welcome back to Week 76 of Synthetic Challenge!! Hope you enjoy the return of a bit of inorganic chemistry! 

Please don't be scared to get things wrong and just have a go!

Too easy? Too hard? Let me know, I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!

Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!

**Rules**

The challenge now contains three synthetic products labelled A, B, and C. Feel free to attempt as many products as you like and please label which you will be attempting in your submission.

You can use any commercially available starting material for the synthetic pathway.

Please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference the technique if it is novel. You do not have to solve the complete synthesis all in one go. If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have done and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution.

You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or if it's too complex to explain in words.

Please have a look at the other submissions and offer them some constructive feedback!

[Structure of Product B](https://i.imgur.com/JMB4bYn.jpg)

[Structure of Product C](https://i.imgur.com/NRSjhU9.jpg)

**BONUS**

This BONUS molecule is for you to make any compound you would like given that the starting material is this molecule. This segment is designed so that you can practice proposing synthetic reactions to build molecule and others can pitch in to determine if the procedures are possible.

Instead of the traditional paradigm of target based synthesis, this is taking the creativity from that and you make whatever end product you desired. If you ever feel stuck with the main challenges A, B, and C, feel free to trying making a random molecule with this bonus and that may inspire some ideas for you or others.

Hello everyone, welcome back to Week 76 of Synthetic Challenge!! Hope you enjoy the return of a bit of inorganic chemistry! 

Please don't be scared to get things wrong and just have a go!

Too easy? Too hard? Let me know, I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!

Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!

**Rules**

The challenge now contains three synthetic products labelled A, B, and C. Feel free to attempt as many products as you like and please label which you will be attempting in your submission.

You can use any commercially available starting material for the synthetic pathway.

Please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference the technique if it is novel. You do not have to solve the complete synthesis all in one go. If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have done and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution.

You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or if it's too complex to explain in words.

Please have a look at the other submissions and offer them some constructive feedback!

[Structure of Product B](https://i.imgur.com/JMB4bYn.jpg)

[Structure of Product C](https://i.imgur.com/NRSjhU9.jpg)

**BONUS**

This BONUS molecule is for you to make any compound you would like given that the starting material is this molecule. This segment is designed so that you can practice proposing synthetic reactions to build molecule and others can pitch in to determine if the procedures are possible.

Instead of the traditional paradigm of target based synthesis, this is taking the creativity from that and you make whatever end product you desired. If you ever feel stuck with the main challenges A, B, and C, feel free to trying making a random molecule with this bonus and that may inspire some ideas for you or others.

**BONUS**

This BONUS molecule is for you to make any compound you would like given that the starting material is this molecule. This segment is designed so that you can practice proposing synthetic reactions to build molecule and others can pitch in to determine if the procedures are possible.

Instead of the traditional paradigm of target based synthesis, this is taking the creativity from that and you make whatever end product you desired. If you ever feel stuck with the main challenges A, B, and C, feel free to trying making a random molecule with this bonus and that may inspire some ideas for you or others.

Hello everyone, welcome back to Week 76 of Synthetic Challenge!! Hope you enjoy the return of a bit of inorganic chemistry! 

Please don't be scared to get things wrong and just have a go!

Too easy? Too hard? Let me know, I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!

Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!

**Rules**

The challenge now contains three synthetic products labelled A, B, and C. Feel free to attempt as many products as you like and please label which you will be attempting in your submission.

You can use any commercially available starting material for the synthetic pathway.

Please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference the technique if it is novel. You do not have to solve the complete synthesis all in one go. If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have done and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution.

You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or if it's too complex to explain in words.

Please have a look at the other submissions and offer them some constructive feedback!

[Structure of Product B](https://i.imgur.com/JMB4bYn.jpg)

[Structure of Product C](https://i.imgur.com/NRSjhU9.jpg)

**BONUS**

This BONUS molecule is for you to make any compound you would like given that the starting material is this molecule. This segment is designed so that you can practice proposing synthetic reactions to build molecule and others can pitch in to determine if the procedures are possible.

Instead of the traditional paradigm of target based synthesis, this is taking the creativity from that and you make whatever end product you desired. If you ever feel stuck with the main challenges A, B, and C, feel free to trying making a random molecule with this bonus and that may inspire some ideas for you or others.

Hello everyone, welcome back to Week 76 of Synthetic Challenge!! Hope you enjoy the return of a bit of inorganic chemistry! 

Please don't be scared to get things wrong and just have a go!

Too easy? Too hard? Let me know, I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!

Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!

**Rules**

The challenge now contains three synthetic products labelled A, B, and C. Feel free to attempt as many products as you like and please label which you will be attempting in your submission.

You can use any commercially available starting material for the synthetic pathway.

Please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference the technique if it is novel. You do not have to solve the complete synthesis all in one go. If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have done and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution.

You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or if it's too complex to explain in words.

Please have a look at the other submissions and offer them some constructive feedback!

[Structure of Product B](https://i.imgur.com/JMB4bYn.jpg)

[Structure of Product C](https://i.imgur.com/NRSjhU9.jpg)

**BONUS**

This BONUS molecule is for you to make any compound you would like given that the starting material is this molecule. This segment is designed so that you can practice proposing synthetic reactions to build molecule and others can pitch in to determine if the procedures are possible.

Instead of the traditional paradigm of target based synthesis, this is taking the creativity from that and you make whatever end product you desired. If you ever feel stuck with the main challenges A, B, and C, feel free to trying making a random molecule with this bonus and that may inspire some ideas for you or others.

Hello everyone, welcome back to Week 76 of Synthetic Challenge!! Hope you enjoy the return of a bit of inorganic chemistry! 

Please don't be scared to get things wrong and just have a go!

Too easy? Too hard? Let me know, I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!

Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!

**Rules**

The challenge now contains three synthetic products labelled A, B, and C. Feel free to attempt as many products as you like and please label which you will be attempting in your submission.

You can use any commercially available starting material for the synthetic pathway.

Please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference the technique if it is novel. You do not have to solve the complete synthesis all in one go. If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have done and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution.

You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or if it's too complex to explain in words.

Please have a look at the other submissions and offer them some constructive feedback!

[Structure of Product B](https://i.imgur.com/JMB4bYn.jpg)

[Structure of Product C](https://i.imgur.com/NRSjhU9.jpg)

**BONUS**

This BONUS molecule is for you to make any compound you would like given that the starting material is this molecule. This segment is designed so that you can practice proposing synthetic reactions to build molecule and others can pitch in to determine if the procedures are possible.

Instead of the traditional paradigm of target based synthesis, this is taking the creativity from that and you make whatever end product you desired. If you ever feel stuck with the main challenges A, B, and C, feel free to trying making a random molecule with this bonus and that may inspire some ideas for you or others.

Hello everyone, welcome back to Week 76 of Synthetic Challenge!! Hope you enjoy the return of a bit of inorganic chemistry! 

Please don't be scared to get things wrong and just have a go!

Too easy? Too hard? Let me know, I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!

Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!

**Rules**

The challenge now contains three synthetic products labelled A, B, and C. Feel free to attempt as many products as you like and please label which you will be attempting in your submission.

You can use any commercially available starting material for the synthetic pathway.

Please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference the technique if it is novel. You do not have to solve the complete synthesis all in one go. If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have done and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution.

You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or if it's too complex to explain in words.

Please have a look at the other submissions and offer them some constructive feedback!

[Structure of Product B](https://i.imgur.com/JMB4bYn.jpg)

[Structure of Product C](https://i.imgur.com/NRSjhU9.jpg)

**BONUS**

This BONUS molecule is for you to make any compound you would like given that the starting material is this molecule. This segment is designed so that you can practice proposing synthetic reactions to build molecule and others can pitch in to determine if the procedures are possible.

Instead of the traditional paradigm of target based synthesis, this is taking the creativity from that and you make whatever end product you desired. If you ever feel stuck with the main challenges A, B, and C, feel free to trying making a random molecule with this bonus and that may inspire some ideas for you or others.

Instead of the traditional paradigm of target based synthesis, this is taking the creativity from that and you make whatever end product you desired. If you ever feel stuck with the main challenges A, B, and C, feel free to trying making a random molecule with this bonus and that may inspire some ideas for you or others.

Hello everyone, welcome back to Week 76 of Synthetic Challenge!! Hope you enjoy the return of a bit of inorganic chemistry! 

Please don't be scared to get things wrong and just have a go!

Too easy? Too hard? Let me know, I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!

Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!

**Rules**

The challenge now contains three synthetic products labelled A, B, and C. Feel free to attempt as many products as you like and please label which you will be attempting in your submission.

You can use any commercially available starting material for the synthetic pathway.

Please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference the technique if it is novel. You do not have to solve the complete synthesis all in one go. If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have done and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution.

You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or if it's too complex to explain in words.

Please have a look at the other submissions and offer them some constructive feedback!

**Products**

[Structure of Product B](https://i.imgur.com/JMB4bYn.jpg)

[Structure of Product C](https://i.imgur.com/NRSjhU9.jpg)

**BONUS**

This BONUS molecule is for you to make any compound you would like given that the starting material is this molecule. This segment is designed so that you can practice proposing synthetic reactions to build molecule and others can pitch in to determine if the procedures are possible.

Instead of the traditional paradigm of target based synthesis, this is taking the creativity from that and you make whatever end product you desired. If you ever feel stuck with the main challenges A, B, and C, feel free to trying making a random molecule with this bonus and that may inspire some ideas for you or others.
