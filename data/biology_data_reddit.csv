4,"Hey Reddit,

I’ve been a lurker for a while, and appreciate all the previous posts and commenters on this topic which becomes kind of redundant. 

I have a degree in Biology and later obtained a degree in Medical Laboratory Science. I hated the clinical lab because it was monotonous. As of now I work in virology research at Hopkins. These skills I am learning are definitely new to me and I would like to use these skills to advance elsewhere. So far I’ve been doing a lot of cell culture, cell lysis, titrations, still learning PCR, and RNA extraction. I am very indecisive when it comes to which M.S. degree I’d like to obtain therefore I’ve been trying to gain as much workplace experience before the big investment.  

Could anyone suggest different routes to take, i’d like to stay busy and engaged and be able to move into different positions. I get bored easily. By the way I’ve been in the clinical lab for 5 yrs and research almost 6 months. 

Thanks!",Laboratory career transition. Help!

10,"I know this gets posted from time to time and is usually met with quips and little else relevant to the actual issue. But I'm actually looking for real information.

&amp;#x200B;

First, *it's a real thing*. It's NOT ""tighten the stomach muscles"" or ""shift gaze and"" or ""think about ..."". Instead it's an internal physical trigger to the sympathetic nervous system (I assume) and an adrenaline spike which causes the blood pressure and heart rate to elevate dramatically, and the pupils to dilate quickly. It doesn't require imagination or setup - one just does it. Accessing it is kind of like tightening a muscle or wiggling one's ears (but it's not a muscle).

&amp;#x200B;

It has the *physical* sensation of fear - that sudden rush if someone jumps out of a bush and goes ""BOO!!"". But it's devoid of emotional content and slower-moving - and can be turned on and halted at will. It does take a bit of focus to maintain, and quickly gets tiring and very slightly nauseating to keep it up for very long. But it's very easy to ""find""

&amp;#x200B;

When I was a teen I once did this while my doctor was taking my blood pressure. He nearly called an ambulance on the spot - it's NOT a subtle effect.

&amp;#x200B;

I later demoed this to an endocrinologist. He was intrigued but said ""nobody does that kind of research anymore - it's all *in vitro* and genetics"". Hyperbole I'm sure, but still.

&amp;#x200B;

Incidentally I've discovered it's quite handy for sobering up. A few minutes of doing this 'forcibly' and I'm much less tipsy.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm wondering if there has ever been actual research on this other than ""my cat can do this"". Does anyone know what exactly is ""triggered"" here? It's pretty obviously the sympathetic nervous system and adrenaline - but HOW? Is it actually some other gland stimulating the adrenals, or a nerve firing somewhere? Has any actual scientist or medical person looked into this?

11,"I'm not doing a masters degree currently but I'm in my 7th semester for my bachelores degree and far from finished. It would take me atleast 2.5 years from now to finish it. 

So I decided to quit. Bachelors is pretty much useless I think so it would be another 2 years for my masters degree, so 4.5 years until I hold something remotely decent in my hands.

To be clear I like biology, that is not the problem. So maybe I shouldn't quit. But I don't even know what the future looks like. What can I even do with a masters degree should I get it? I know I should know what happens next but I really don't know shit.

My impression is that even with a masters degree pretty much only academia is an option and that it is hard and long work. I don't care that much about money but I feel like I'm definitely not a hard worker that dedicates their life to the profession.

If any europeans or germans could offer insight that would be most helpful as I can imagine the situation to be very different between the US and europe.

Edit: I think what I gather from this is that indeed with a bachelors you probably at best get a job as a lab technician and that there are more opportunities with a masters. I have the feeling that people who get jobs in the industry with a masters usually are the really ambitious and engaged type though. Most positive things are that you can climb up more or figure out later what you want to do. ",If I finish a masters degree in biology in a average or below average manner what can I do next?

I have been struggling so much with this class and I seriously need help.
This class has 3 professors and 4 exams, and the professors change after every exam so theres practically no way of knowing the pattern of the exam and thus on what to study for. No practice questions are given in the class. Because all professors are new to teaching this course (genetics), theres no previous exams available. I looked online to look for some practice but this class only briefly covers the mechanisms and mostly focus on case studies (like journal articles) that applies those concepts, so theres no online practice materials that pertain to the class. The mechanisms are also upper level so theres not much practice test other than very basic ones, which aren't helpful. Problems on the back of the chapter on the textbook are all free response questions with no answer solutions, while the class exam is all multiple choice based. They also require knowledge that the book covers but the lectures don't so they are not helpful either. No studies guides are given.

The last professor's exam was very tricky; if you miss a miniscule detail that you though would not come up on an exam, you get an application question that requires that knowledge wrong.

So I have been transcribing everything the professor says and have been rewriting my notes  everyday. To prepare for application questions,  I have beencomingth my own questions. But as I come up with my own questions, I get confused on what-if's that the lecture nor the textbook does not explicitly covers, and finding the answers to those question online are very time consuming.

The rewriting is also very time consuming, as I basically write all lectures that has been covered from memory and compare it to the notes to see what I have missed, everyday. Because I transcribe my notes, theres a ton of information and I always miss something, even though I do this everyday.

This whole process leaves me to study for this course at least for 5 hours everyday this whome semester, and much more on weekends. I basically have no free time and would like to spend some time improving other areas or investing  in extracurricular activities. I am beginning to think I am wasting too much time but I don't know what to change because I am worried that I will fail the exam and ruin my GPA.

Is this typical of college bio course? Theres no curve, no study guides, no practice materials to efficiently self-assess my knowledge. I never know if I am prepared enough and cannot stop studying. This semester has been so frustrating because of this course.

55,"HI,

I'm thinking of taking an intro to biology class at a community college (US).  I'm a 56 y.o. male, a c.c. teacher myself, whose background is in the arts and education.  

**What is the content of an introductory biology course?** I've looked around at syllabi, some open source textbooks, etc.  but am not sure what the core is. There seem to be a lot different topics.  I'm assuming there are going to be differences from one school to the next, but there must be some basics that every course covers. I do plan on getting a hold of the syllabus for the specific course before I decide, so that will help,  I suppose.

**What are the difficulties that non-science majors face in this course?**  Is there demanding math/computations?  Is there much rote memorization?  Is there difficulty with learning about the physical world that you can't readily visualize (e.g. atoms)? Prerequisite knowledge?

**Would an intensive, online version during the summer be an option?** The course is offered in different formats.  I was thinking of taking it in the Fall in a full-semester F2F course.  I do well F2F.   It's also offered this summer in an intensive 5-week format online and F2F.  Though it is intensive, the advantage would be that I would be able to focus all my attention on it because I'll only be teaching a low-level morning class and will have really the rest of the day and weekends to put into the class.  Really, just about all my time during the 5 weeks could be devoted to the class.  I'm a good student. :) Taking the full-semester version F2F would mean having my boatload of teaching and administrative duties to take care of at the same time. That can be tough as I've seen when I took other classes.    I have no problems with the technology piece of taking tests online, using online materials, etc.  

**Is interest enough?**  Finally, I DO have interest in the ""hard"" sciences, but I haven't had a lot of experiences with them over the last 30 + years.  :)  I'm just not sure I have ""the mind"" if that makes sense.  Even when I advise my own students, I can tell that there is often a gray area between their interests and their innate skill toward certain subjects.  I'm not expecting to become a biologist. I just want to get the fundamental concepts of the biology. And, this could be a required piece in later life plans, so I would like the credits.

**Are there materials online that could give me a jump start, things that would cover basics that every intro to bio course would have to cover?**

Lately I've been enjoying the new podcast on the disappearance of Madeleine McCann (it's called ""Maddie"" if anyone wants to check it out). In the latest episode, the host considers some DNA evidence from the case that may have pointed to her parents being criminally involved and which was ruled inconclusive 10 years ago. In explaining why it was ruled inconclusive, he said a few things that I was confused by.

He said that the methods to test for DNA matches are ""subjective"": in what sense is that? Is he referring to the technical manipulations in lab (unlikely - wouldn't there be a protocol?), is he talking about the statistical methods (I assume matches are tested via standard ttest methods, wherein the alpha is subjective, but, like, not in a this-is-baloney way), or is traditional DNA testing a pretty standard procedure and he's just talking about measurement error etc?

I’m an Organismal Biology undergraduate and my capstone has consisted of reading research articles about a certain topic and then for the final paper I’m supposed to write a 10 page paper that uses the papers that I’ve read to create a review of the subject due to the research, or write a thesis. I’d like to write a thesis because I feel like it’s easier to fill up 10 pages if I’m creating an argument, but I can’t think of a point to argue.

The papers that I’ve been reading all semester center around symbiosis between two or more organisms and the majority of new research is all about microbial symbiosis between larger eukaryotes and their microbial symbionts, whether they be archaea, prokaryotes, or fungi. Some of the research teams use animal and microbial models to observe how symbioses may have evolved in the first place. Examples of the large eukaryotes and their inhabited structures are sea sponges, scent glands in tree frogs, fish gills, tree roots, human gut, aquatic ciliates, salamander embryos, kleptoplasty in sea slugs etc. I’m more interested in aquatic eukaryotes, but I’m not afraid to find research that would support my argument in terrestrial symbiosis as well.

85,"So I tried engineering for a couple of months and I really hated it. Looking back, the reason that I picked it was because of how poor the job prospects in biology are. There was nothing remotely positive about my experience there. I did not find the advanced projects interesting, could care less about the technological aspects, and found the careers mind numbingly boring. 

That in mind, I switched to microbiology/genetics. I don't hate the content I am learning anymore, which is great, but it is a little under-stimulating still. (I'm in all lower division, weeder courses. I've learned all of this content in high school before, so it excited me the first three times, now I am like okay lets move on.) What worries me is what will the future look like for me? I am stuck in a position where I will have to take out around 50,000 in loans to cover my schooling. A bachelors in biology will not sustain that kind of debt. Additionally, I looked up entry level jobs for my state and most of them were $12-13 dollars with an occasional 15 thrown in there. My job now pays 11. 

Additionally, I love science, but I don't want to dedicate my life to this. I want to be able to own a boat, travel, and have a life outside of work. I'm not really interested in having a family, but I'd like autonomy over my life. It doesn't seem like a bachelors in bio gives you this kind of life.

I don't want to have any contact with patients/treating people, it doesn't remotely interest me at all. Medical school/PA/pre-professional is off the table completely. I could go into the food/fisheries/environmental sector and probably be satisfied. I'd love to avoid grad school if I could, but I'd settle for a masters I guess. My school does have an MLS major, but after learning more about it, I don't think it's a path for me. 

I am also AWFUL with computers and technology. I have taken probably 3 or 4 CS classes in my day and failed all 3 of them. Math or physics don't scare me, but they aren't things I want to turn into a career. I'm very bad with stats, but can handle calculus. 

I'm not one of those people who's hooked on the idea of field work or being outside, but I could never work a job at a desk for a living. I work a desk job now and I want to pull my hair out everyday. I think about quitting every shift.

***Original post:***

Tonight while viewing my blood for the first time since I began these experiments something very informative occurred. All that I had been theorizing and shouting had been correct. Here is my blood almost entirely in apoptosis. As theorized, this was a result of many months of consistent magnetic interference. The fields themselves act as waves; or you could think of two fields as two bubbles/balloons pressing against one another. If you do this long enough and at the right frequency you can ensure the cells conform to what is needed. This is expected to lead to cancer dispersals, polarization techniques and ultimately growth and nervous system aid.

At this stage I will be halting all further experiments to monitor how these changes decay into renormalized systems. As I feel there are significant changes I will begin again to adjust them and see if any body manipulations through the recycling of these cells is possible upon cell death or via pointing to specific locations.

Many things I have posted in the past were widely rejected and in some cases ridiculed. As a result I will not be responding to any non question comments here.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are images of my blood. This is incredibly important as it proves cells can in fact be influenced appropriately by magnetic fields and current.

I've been working unpaid in a genetics lab on campus as an assistant and as a student researcher in a stream ecology lab paid. So I have at least two very strong letters of recommendation and my GPA isn't half bad either.

We know that the type of the receptor in an organ determines if the signal will pass through or not. So, we have some parts of the body that increase activity, others that decrease activity and other parts that do nothing. How the receptors come in play? Does epinephrine for example is released on both an organ that increases activity and another that decreases activity? or goes only to the increased-activity organ?

This is a bit out of their wheelhouse because my usage is unorthodox for the scope, mostly being used in the medical field. My goal is to use my Nikon d610 to take pics through the mic.

What I would like to do I guess is remove the head &gt; mount an adaptor to the mic &gt; connect camera &gt; run camera to monitor for display. Is this possible?

As far as I can tell the head redirects the light through the ocular lens which adds magnification. I understand that if I remove those optics I will lose magnification unless the adaptor has optics.

I know from working with extension tubes that the distance from the glass and the sensor will affect the image as well, this might need to be a specific distance for sharp pictures.

I'll try to make it short as english isn't my first language.

After around 15 minutes or so I started to develop severe stomach cramp-like pains that would last for 30-60 seconds and that felt as if acid was destroying my stomach. I'm not really overexaggerating, the pain was pretty bad. That kept going on for probably 20 minutes every 2-3 minutes or so. I stood in front of the toilet cause I had the feeling that I had to vomit but I couldn't. I burped a lot and the burps smelled like sour/ acidlike sulfur, really aggressive smell. I know NAC contains Sulphur... After that time it kinda faded.. When I ate something 2 hours later the pain became very aggressive again, after every swallow, this time a severe short timed cramp in my stomach , maybe even esophagus, can't really tell..

Anyways, I am worried, it is now 8 hours later and my stomach still slightly hurts and feels kind of""inflammated"". What I should maybe add that 2 days ago I had a light stabbing sensation in my stomach/back the whole day but that faded. Could it be a stomach ulcer? If so, why did the NAC had that severe reaction on me? (It must have been the NAC, because the strong smell of my burps) One last thing: I kinda tend to have that reaction, when you swallow down a supplement, let'say my Maca, there is this lumpy sensations afterwards in my stomach and a few minutes later my burps have that intense smell of the supplement I ingested as it was in the case of NAC.

I am at the second year of my master's course in Applied and Experimental Biology, and I recently joined a research lab in a hospital to prepare my graduation thesis. This is my first time working in a research lab, and most important it is the first time splitting my life between working and studying. Fortunately there are no classes left to attend, but I have four exams left to do. I will be working in the lab at least until april 2020, when I plan to graduate.

Right now I'm just working 3 times a day, but since next week I will be working full time monday-friday from 9 to 6, and since they are not very eager to give me free days to study, I fear I will not be able to stick to my plan to graduate in april next year if I cannot study properly.

Fact is that as much as I like being in the lab, I really find the work to be challenging and draining and I fear that doing that every day non-stop will hinder my ability to study properly and to stick to my plan to graduate in april next year. I also fear that in the upcoming year my days will just be packed with lab work and studying, without any time left for social life or any other hobby I like. Silly at it may sound, since I always enjoyed reading, playing the guitar and excercising to keep me healthy both phisically and mentally, the idea of losing almost 50 hours in my weeks is just terrifying.

I would appreciate to know if some of you found himself in a similar situation in his master's and how you were able to deal with it, and I would also appreciate opinions on how I could pull the best out of the lab work, avoiding it to become an overwhelming and stressful experience.

Another example: If a heart evolved before blood vessels, there would be no circulation, it would be impossible to give oxygen to other organs, all other organs would die. But if blood vessels evolved before the heart, there would be no force to propel blood. Also same with heart and lungs they both absolutely need each other to function.

Now to the person that suggests these events evolved simultaneously at a very slow gradual level and got better over time: That doesn’t make sense, a cell couldn’t survive with such primitive means early on, it needs so many mechanisms to live.

**B/** The reflexive arc is followed by the ***stress response*** (but of course it's not mandatory for the enablement of the stress response).

The types of stressors are separated in two big categories the ***psychosocial responses*** that require *cognitive appraisal* and the **biogenic stressors** that are *automatic* (like the effects of caffeine, drugs or extreme heat).

There are also two paths that lead to anxiety, the [**cerebral cortex path**](https://www.healthcentral.com/article/pathways-to-anxiety-the-cerebral-cortex) and the [**amygdala path**](https://www.healthcentral.com/article/pathways-to-anxiety-the-amygdala).

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions:**

1. Is everything that I am saying correct?
2. Does the *stress response* from *biogenic stressors* passes the *amygdala* to enable the response?
3. If (2) is true, can we draw the conclusion that *psychosocial stressors* follow the *cerebral cortex path* and the *biogenic stressors* follow the *amygdala path*?

226,"Evolution, especially the punctuated evolution of entire organ systems, seems to occur much faster than random chance would allow. Although the theory of complex self-organizing systems may provide part of the answer, I believe there is another possibility: intra-genomic gaming.

DNA is, in a way, a model of the physical world since its instruction set must allow an organism to survive in the world. But as a model it can also be seen as a ""gaming"" environment. Genes could game with each other, intra-genomically, in creating nascent organic systems - with the system matching the real-world constraints of the gaming environment being the winner. This would then be expressed as the birth of a mutation - but by intra-genomic gaming rather than just mutation due to radiation or chance. Since the genome could ""evolve"" in this way at a much greater speed than in the physical world, we explain why the speed of evolution is so much greater than can be allowed purely by random mutation.

The mutation would then, of course, be subject to natural selection, depending on its viability. We are not throwing out the very well proven theory of natural selection, just accounting for it having a speed greater than can be explained by chance. This concept must of course be verified in the lab, but I feel it has a good chance of being true. ",intra-genomic gaming

272,"**Intro:**

I recently graduated (debt free) from an Honor's BSc in biology with a minor in statistics. I managed to get above average grades and research experience (2 published papers). I've followed the natural progression from here (without much thought) and I've been accepted to a Master's program in genomics/synthetic biology in a well known lab (**starting this May**). For the past few months I've got a head start on lab work and I've begun getting interesting results. 

**Problem:**

1. The postdoc I am working with is a control freak, micromanages my work, and criticizes details of what I do that are essentially personal preference, which I think will be increasingly  annoying over the course of my master's (I had more independence doing research as an undergrad). However, he/she is very smart and their help will undoubtedly increase my productivity. Also, I do not feel like the general environment of this lab is bringing out my full potential, and I am rarely excited and stimulated by my project. I also do not see myself pursuing the academic career path without going nuts, so I'm thinking of working in industry after my MSc.
2. I often find myself thinking about how interesting and fun it was learning statistics (through my minor), and how it contrasted with biology by being a widely applicable tool and a marketable skill (lol). I enjoy and miss the problem solving/puzzle aspect of statistics and think I could enjoy computer science for this reason. Thus, I have found myself looking up statistics/CS undergrad programs in my area. I also believe that I have the skills to succeed in this field (I had better grades in stats courses than stats majors), and career prospects will be much better.

I don't want to be indecisive and simply start this MSc without being certain that it's the best choice for me.

I realize that a second undergrad would require much more time and money. I would be able to complete my MSc debt free because of awards/stipend, but a second undergrad would surely require me to take on student loans.  I am increasingly thinking about the improved career prospects and how it may be better financially in the long run, and how I am not fully stimulated by my current work. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions to reddit:**

Has/does anyone here :

\-been in a similar situation? What did you choose and what was the outcome?

\-have any pointers or things to consider before committing to either direction? 

\-have insights about current and future job prospects in biotech/pharma

The creatures live for 50 years and are able to reproduce until their mid-thirties, they're also close to our size. The creature's pregnancy time is 8 months, the birthing process takes a very short time and is almost painless, rarely lasting longer than 2 minutes.

The babies are physically weak when they come out but are not helpless, after a short time 30 minutes to an hour, the babies are able to move without problems, like a baby deer. The mother herself doesn't care for her newborn offspring, after giving birth she cleans up and then moves on, opting to leave her young in the care of the community as a whole. This creature only gives birth to one offspring at a time, with the rare occasion of twins or triplets.

The creature's growth cycle goes like this.

Year 1: Rapid physical developement (start out as barely mobile toddlers, end as roughly the same physicality of a three-year-old)

Year 2: Rapid mental development (their intelligence goes from rudimentary and animalistic to being much smarter at the end of the year)

Year 3: Same rate as year 1, the body develops further, getting closer to the adult form, the creature's equivalent of being 8 years old, is now able to be an independent and functional member of their pack and is no longer cared for by the rest of the community.

Year 4: Same rate as year 2, their intelligence increases to almost it's fullest potential

My original plan was to go to med school or go into research/academia, but due to health issues that are out of my control, I have physical limitations that prevent me from doing either of those things. I cannot stand for long amounts of time, and I have developed a mast cell condition that basically makes me allergic to any chemical I'd work with in a lab. I need suggestions for a sitting job that does not involve exposure to harsh chemicals, lab chemicals, or food (I cannot touch foods I am allergic to, although I have enough tolerance to be around them). My passion has always been helping people, and I wanted to go into the healthcare industry to do this. However, I cannot rationalize putting myself into six figure debt and then possibly having to drop out because I cannot stand long enough to complete the 12+ hour shifts required for the clinical rotations that are a part of nursing, medical school, and physician's assistant school programs. Working in a biomedical research lab post-graduation was my Plan B, and was something I was passionate about because I figured I could help people through scientific research (plus I love the actual science that medicine is based on - the molecular knitty-gritty about why a particular drug works, the pathogenesis of disease, bacterial gene expression - that stuff is fascinating AF to me, and I loved working with bacteria and studying their gene expression). I did that for about 9 months before developing MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome), which basically made me allergic to all of the chemicals I worked with, forcing me to leave my job. I love microbiology (specifically bacteriology), molecular biology, and genetics, and would like to try to do some sort of work involving them, but I am coming up dry with potential careers. I would ideally like to continue to work in science doing something that helps people.

441,"Hi, first post here and I’m not exactly sure if this is the right place to post, but I could use some advice.

So  I’m currently in my last semester of undergrad. I’m finishing up my  bachelors degree in Bioinformatics but I’m completely at a loss as to  what to do with it.

My program is  structured in that I’m essentially a Biology major with a CS minor, but I  realized it’s not very helpful. I originally chose this path because I  was premed and I was fascinated with programming and what it could do.

However,  over time I’ve become jaded, as I struggled with the weedout premed  courses of my major (biochem, organic chem, physics) and became  disillusioned with the general premed culture (the toxicity is huge, and  I’m not a fan of cramming info only to regurgitate it for an exam and  then forget about it all right after).

I  was planning on switching halfway through my junior year to something more practical, like CS or Stats, but decided  against it due to time and money constraints, as  at that point I’ve  already finished practically 80% of the curriculum.

I  honestly wish I switched then and there, as my GPA isn’t so hot, its in the sub 3.0 range, about somwhere between 2.8 - 2.9, and I'm not taking many classes this semester, so I don't think I'll be able to raise it to a 3.0, so I don’t think grad school is an option anymore. It sucks because I've considered getting an MS in something tech or analytics related, but now I don't even have this option.

I have some  knowledge of stats and programming, but its mostly linked towards data  parsing and visualization, so I mainly work with Perl, Bash, SQL, and  some R, but I still have much to learn compared to the average CS major, so I feel like a jack of all trades, but a master of none.

I don’t have much research  experience, only having about 1 years worth of doing mostly wet lab benchwork, so no  data analytics here.  Any internships I do have are not science related at all, being in the sociopolitical field.

How  should I approach the job search? As this is the part I find most  daunting. I like research but I can’t see myself doing that as a career,  as I’m kind of sick of academia, especially anything biochem related  and I feel that everything is going to become automated soon, so less lab jobs. 

Sorry for  the long post but I’m just feeling really lost and anxious as  graduations right around the corner and I’m trying to find a job, but I  feel so under-qualified  for any position I come across, anything Bioinformatics or research related wants 3-5 years of experience and an MS. I’d really just  like some advice on how to best approach my situation.",Feeling Lost... Could use some advice.

I’m a 4th year (senior) majoring in Biology (BA) and in order to graduate I have to do a Senior Capstone project. This project entails a science related question/research topic on literature (essentially a 10-15 page literature review) followed by a presentation at the end of the semester. 

I’m currently aiming to go to school to be a Veterinarian but have lower GPA scores (a 3.4) than the desired 3.75. I love animals and science overall and really am struggling with a topic I could explore that would make me stand out to potential vet schools as well as something that would just be really fun and intriguing for me to research. I may as well choose a topic I enjoy if I’m going to be putting so much hard work and dedication into it. 

Problem is, I’m not the top of my class. I’m smart, I was a high school honors student but it took me 2 years into college to really learn how to study and get the A’s I knew I could get. I’m smart but I doubt myself way more than I should. I fear sounding like an idiot and mixing up basic biology or making a paper that sounds like gibberish. I think I’m too hard on myself but this is a huge project and I want to make it count and just overall help me stand out/feel like I’ve done some independent hard work by myself. I haven’t been able to be apart of any research teams or labs on campus, and I’ve only ever been able to just take the required courses I need for graduation, doing well of course but I still compare myself negatively to people who have had opportunities or started research under professors earlier on. I feel like a failure by just taking classes and doing well but not being able to do anything extracurricular. 

Anyways, point being. I’d love some unique topic ideas that I could possibly consider for my literature paper that may be related to the career I’m striving for. Some examples the professor who is supervising my independent study has told me in the past students have discussed things like methods of muscle building such as if it makes a difference if you lift weights before vs. doing some other muscle building activity, etc. Another student discussed the bacteria present in local untreated-water supplies and how those bacteria could play a part on our health, or bioterrorism attacks, etc etc. 

The idea for topics is broad so that we can really narrow it down to something we’re interested in but my anxiety on the topic and fears are inhibiting my thought process on coming up with a topic that I can successfully talk about but that is correlated to my potential interests.

I'm not a scientist and I certainly like my job in marketing and am not looking for a new career, but, I have scientist friends and really want to talk to them about their work. 

Below is a brief of what I already know. I want to get to cellular biology. I obviously need some chemistry and biology knowledge in order to get there.

My question is this, without access to labs, instructors or anything like that, what's the path to getting to my goal. I can fill in gaps later, so what are the essential basics to getting from my knowledge base to cellular biology? 

I would say I have an 8th grade to high school sophomore level of education on basic biology. I have a 7th grade understanding of chemistry. I have a pretty advanced understanding of anatomy and human biology.

I had a roommate that was a biologist working on the human microbiome in built environments. She brought me up to speed on CRISPR and the basics of gene editing. 

I have a friend that used to run sequencing for various samples for college researchers and has been explaining Cas9 and the research he does in the private sector with nematodes. 

It's to the point where my complete lack of chemistry knowledge (can balance chemical equations, ionic/covalent bonds, rudimentary understanding of the periodic table), has led me to realize there is a huge gap in my knowledge that I want to fill.

Hello,

I need some advice. I am recently finishing my PhD in Neuroscience and have concluded that I do not want – for ethical reasons – to work with animals anymore. I am, however, very interested in the possibility of going into computational biology/neuroscience research – hopefully to develop computational models that may one day substitute laboratory animals.

The problem is I have little to no background in computer science/programming, aside from a little HTML and some rudimentary Python and have no idea where to start. Which is why I am here: does any of you work in computational biology/neuroscience, and if so could you tell me what would be a starting point for me to work on, in terms of skills/knowledge, that could lead me to eventually go into this field?

I am aware that this is a profound career change, and one I am not expecting to make in a short amount of time, and that it will not be easy. But this is something I truly want and willing to put the effort in for.

488,"Protect laboratory workers and the surrounding environment from pathogens with a Biosafety Cabinet (BSC). A HEPA filter helps remove harmful bacteria and viruses from all exhaust air exiting the biosafety cabinet. Biological safety cabinets also serve the purpose to maintain the sterility of material inside the enclosure. 90% of all Biosafety cabinets installed are Type A2. 

Class II Cabinets provide protection to samples and the environment since harmful contaminants are removed by a HEPA filter. There are five types of Biosafety cabinets: Type A1, Type A2, Type B1, Type B2, and Type C1. Each type of cabinets requirements is outlined by NSF International Standard. 

Fans mounted inside the cabinet pull air around the user and into the cabinet protecting the operator. The air travels underneath the work surface and pushed to the top of the unit where it passes through HEPA filters. After being filtered, sterile air is blown downward over products and material inside the enclosure to prevent contamination. Depending on the Type of Class II cabinet, filtered air can be exhausted through a HEPA filter back into the laboratory or pulled by an exhaust fume system where it is expelled from the building. 

 Maintenance and Services

Proper maintenance of a biosafety cabinet assures effective use of the containment device. The life span of a HEPA filter will depend on the type of particles generated inside the biosafety cabinet. Changing the filter can be done after the cabinet has been decontaminated or a “bag-in/bag-out” procedure. 

Changing the filter should be handled by a trained person as the filter is potentially contaminated. 

Monitor Air Flow. As the filter load increases so does the amount of work needed by the internal fan to push the same volume of air through the filter. Newer cabinets measure air flow and self adjust the fan performance to ensure a steady volume of air moving through the unit.

514,"Melatonin secretion is triggered in the evening in the absence of short wavelengths of the visible spectrum (or when they start to disappear due to their scattering in the evening). By short wavelengths I mean roughly those below 564 nm for humans, the number is species dependent. How is melatonin secretion regulated if people are in absolute darkness for prolonged periods of time e.g. like months in those famous cave experiments? I was told it is governed by the natural internal clock in all of us, and that for most people this clock has a period a bit longer or a bit shorter than 24 hours. This means that in absolute darkness, melatonin secretion would start approximately a few hours before sleep just thanks to the clock even without light? But how does the internal clock ""count"" the time in the absence of light and it's different spectrum during the daytime and evening? I was told that gene expression governs the clock, but this poses the same question - how do genes display periodicity of transcription and translation without the cue of light?

Or do people secrete melatonin all the time in total darkness even when fully awake?

557,"I’ll write out what I know so anyone can tell me if I have a flawed understanding of something/am missing info

I’ve learned that in order for myosin to bind to actin and cause contraction, it needs to have a molecule of ATP which is then hydrolyzed into ADP + phosphate ion, putting it into a higher energy conformation that primes it to bind with actin. When the tropomyosin moves out of the way and allows the myosin and actin to bind, it uses the energy from the hydrolysis reaction to slide the filaments along each other and hold them rigid. Then the myosin lets go of its ADP + Phosphate and another ATP takes its place, making the myosin unbind with actin to repeat the process.

My questions are:

What determines the length of time that actin and myosin can stay connected? I have a limited understanding of physics, but wouldn’t it cost more energy to keep them bound and rigid for longer? If they only release after another ATP molecule makes its way to the myosin, what happens in the absence of ATP?

Additionally, after it gets a new ATP and enters a resting state, when does it decide to hydrolyze it?",When/why does myosin unbind with actin?

I am 27 years old and, long story short, I want to be able to work/research in Antarctica. The catch is I don’t even have an associate’s degree. I am planning on attending community college in the fall (I ~might~ even take summer classes)  to get through all the gen eds as quickly and cheaply as I can. 

However, the other catch is I barely attended high school. I wasn’t a drop out or anything like that, my parents just “tried” to “homeschool” me (for lack of wanting to explain the actual
situation) which ultimately resulted in me being pretty uneducated. I am intelligent though! And I really want to finally educate myself.

But I DO know that I would really like to eventually do research/work on Antarctica for a time. So whatever direction I go, I want to be able to be qualified enough for that...... if Antarctica’s ice will even still be there by then.......... lol

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have these 15 cm plates, and this is where my confusion begins...

&amp;#x200B;

**PROBLEM**: I was told I have to do some math regarding the surface areas of the 15 cm plate and 6-well plates as a means to determine how much cells I need to add to each well to get a nice even distribution. I was told to split my 15 cm plate into 6-well plates in a 1:3 ratio (not sure what this means...); ***I need to make at least four or five 6-well plates for transfections***.

&amp;#x200B;

I did some math, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it correctly :

\[15 cm Surface Area (cm\^2)\]/\[6-well plate Surface Area (cm\^2)\] = (176.71 cm\^2)/(9.62 cm\^2) = 18.369 = approx. 18 fold concentration of cells?

&amp;#x200B;

So based on this, does this mean I have to take 1/18 of the cells from the 15 cm plate and add them into each well of a 6-well plate? How would I actually do this? Like:

\- How much trypsin should I use to coat the entire 15 cm plate?

\- How much PBS (Wash) should I then use to wash my cells?

\- At this point, I'll have whatever amount of trypsin and PBS, and I'd have spun it down to get a pellet. After aspirating the supernatent, How much DMEM media should I use to resuspend the pellet?

642,"Hey friends of life science. I'm a lurker here, and just had a few questions because I'm scared as shit for the future, is all. 

&amp;#x200B;

today I was having a conversation with my friend who is an engineer, and he's a decade older than I am. I was telling him how stressed out I am recently for my biology class I'm retaking (Foundations Bio, I know, loser, gotta catch up) but its really because I'm well aware that I'm not studying NEARLY as much as I should. I just got back into University classes since about almost 2 years ago. In between that time I was completing my foreign language requirements for my university at the local community college for a year. Now that I'm back at Uni, holy SHIT. I forgot how much more effort is required for these classes, the weed out classes, even though it's foundations.. It is rated as a difficult course, for sure. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway... I was talking with him about what I want to do, or don't know what I want to do with Biology. He basically made it seem like a biology degree is low paying jobs and not much out there unless I continue education and such; just kind of got me a little more worried about the future of my career. I took 3 years at Indiana State, transferred to University Of Iowa due to out of state tuition rates, and different state rules to gain state residency for cheaper school, did language requirements/one class a semester/ work 30h a week etc. I basically have to do that over again as they said they didn't even receive all the information they needed, and that I wasn't at all aware that they limit the credit hours to 4 in the summer, and 6 the rest of the academic year, which is absurd in my opinion. As i was finishing up spanish, I took my last 2 spanish courses in the summer totaling 8 credit hours, and they said that basically fucked me for my residency, so I may be able to re do half of it, since I was taking 6h and working last fall, which could count. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I am now in my 5th year of college, and have to pay my own way ($1,800/4credit hours) a semester, and if I take ONE more credit hour, I kid you not the price goes up at least $5,000. So I have to take one class/semester. Also, everyone is on a different timeline, so Im just going to finish up what I have left here and see where I can go. I have always loved biology. I grew up with an OBGYN for a mother, which is a blessing, and just have always asked questions about science/how to get better from being sick, bla bla bla. So I've always been science oriented. I just don't really know what I want still; I'm confident I'll find SOMETHING, in due time, which is why I chose Biology as a broad degree as it can give me a myriad of careers to choose from. I am just asking what careers are out there that require a Biology degree. I just received my AA in December, so there's something, I guess. But I don't know guys, I'm just stressin out over my study habits, academic ethic, and If I'm really even cut out for this shit. I'm just looking for any guidance, advice and tips on looking for careers in Biology. Sure, I'll probably be able to get a shitty ""starter"" job out of college to survive on for a few years, but I'm asking anyone who has a biology degree, or what options ARE out there. I'm going to stop now as I could tell you my life story if I haven't already, but I am just a little lost as it is hard to take it one day at a time by looking at everything including the future into perspective.

This past fall semester I took chem 1 lecture and lab, and biology 1 lecture and lab. This semester I’m in chem 2 lecture &amp; lab and bio 2 lecture &amp; lab. So far I’ve loved bio, and chem has been a struggle. I really wanna avoid organic chemistry if possible at all, but if I don’t take it, I can’t get a BS or go to grad school. I took chem in high school and struggled, went to art school thinking I’d never have to deal with it again, and now here I am! I just think if I’m struggling in general chemistry I’ll die in ochem 1 and 2. Also have to take labs with those, and I’m not a huge fan of chem lab right now. So it seems like it’ll be a rough go if I have to take another year of chemistry classes. 

I want to work at a zoo or aquarium or wildlife center or honestly anything involving animals. For a career in that, is a BA in biology useless? I’ve looked at jobs and careers online that I’d love to do one day, and they all require a bachelor’s in biology or other life sciences. It never specifies BA or BS, but I’m assuming BS is preferred. And I don’t want to get a BA and then realize I’m fucked and unemployable.

There's a lot of conflicting info out there about how to eat healthily. Tim Spector studies the microbiome to gain insight into how its diversity can impact health outcomes.  The microbiome is the community of 100 trillion microbes that live in our colon that are like a virtual organ. This organ is key to our digestion, appetite, mood, metabolism, and control of our immune system.  It is also key to how we respond to immunotherapy and chemotherapy. The TwinsUK cohort of 12,000+ twins has been running for nearly 25 years and is now the most intensively studied group of humans on the planet (www.twinsuk.ac.uk). Having deep sequence, metabolites, epigenetics, immune traits and dietary and health data, in 2012 a stool collection for 16S microbiome, metagenomes and metabolomics was added. They are currently using the microbiome data and cohort to provide novel measures of health, such as the level of microbial diversity and a new measure – the microbial health index and how this impacts overall health outcomes. Tim Spector's team's twin work has also enabled them to gain insights into the microbiome and immune interactions of the upper colon and small intestine via colonoscopy and interventions. Every medical professional needs to know about maintaining a healthy microbiome from birth to death.

Worldwide, over 80 plant species are known to cause poisoning from nitrate accumulation. But droughts are exacerbating this for many staple crops. Even after a drought, the growth in water-stressed crops can result in the build-up of other toxins. Global warming is also helping to spread mycotoxins, with 25 per cent of cereals worldwide estimated to be contaminated and 4.5 billion people exposed to uncontrolled levels. We will need an aggressive strategy to ensure the safety of agricultural yields and food in the future especially in drought- prone and even temperate zones.

There were a few instances when he brought up the worms and parasites that have been observed to seemingly “control the minds” of other animals.  An example that comes to mind is the species that causes specific snails to make themselves vulnerable to predation by birds.

By extension, I started to wonder what the mechanisms of such interactions are.  Is the parasite changing the conscious decisions of its host?  Is the host behaviour simply an attempt to reduce the strain applied by the parasite (ex. moving upwards to alleviate a permanently induced feeling of downward movement)?

Why is it then, that we believe humans need to shower frequently at risk of turning into smelly oily beasts, prone to infection? Surely we would not have evolved this way, and through most of human history, it would seem that frequent washing was either not done or simply not possible. I have always been perplexed by this, and haven't used soap or shampoo for years without telling anybody. I have never once been told I smell bad, even after I had just gotten back from a run, drenched in sweat (my sweat doesn't really have a smell), and I have even gotten complements from girls asking what my hair routine was (I have long wavy hair and am a guy). Recently I have started to just stop rising myself off in the shower all together, mostly because having a full head of thick wet hair in the dead of winter is a bit of a drag, and I have noticed literally zero side effects. When most people in western society don't shower for a few days, they get irritated, oily skin and hair, and tend to develop a foul odor, am I some sort of genetic anomaly? I don't think so, I think that constantly washing off the natural oils and  bacteria causes your body to overproduce those things to compensate.

Hello friends, fellow scholars and broskis,

So I am an undergraduate bio engineer working in this cell lab.

So my PI wants us (Phd and I) to publish in nature, but or paper **literally only has western blot data**. From previous experience i know that western blot data is supposed to be supplementary. But my PI does not want to spend extra money on any other method. I tried everything to convince him, even sent him nature papers saying wetern blot is not very trustworthy.

Am I the asshole for doubting him as he is the authority ?

the Phd im helping out is seriously stressed out to the point that she got ulcers and is depressed. I don't know what to do. I love this lab and have been a part of it since freshmen year. Advice is appreciated.

Now, throughout the entirety of science education (in the US), students are taught evolution, natural selection, and Darwinism via the phrase ""survival of the fittest."" While I know that this was the phrase that Darwin likely coined to sell his theory, it is a phrase that persists to this day. In primary school I think this is a good tool to help young students understand the most basic concept of evolution. However, this phrase ""survival of the fittest"" persists at the University level even among higher level genetics and biology courses and typically treated as a truth rather than a concept. 

&amp;#x200B;

The phrase ""survival of the fittest is great of depicting or understanding survivability of an organism given a single stressor. For example, a most fit organism would be a bacteria with resistance to a particular class of antibiotics and able to survive an antibiotic course. However, I think this an unfit simplification of population genetics when speaking of survivability of a population as a whole. I argue that it would be better (at least at University level) to at least have students understand that evolution in terms of population genetics comes out in the wild as more ""survival of the average."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I will use class grading as a ""real world"" example. Lets say you're taking a class and your grade is determined by the cumlative work of homework, exams, papers, presentations. At the end of the class your grades are compiled and if you graph all of the grades, you will get a bell curve with a majority of students earning a ""C"" grade. If you break down the individual strengths of each student, you can see that some students can have better grades in some areas compared to others and/or be the best in all categories which theoretically improves or decreases the ability of each student to be ""well suited"" for this class. In terms of survivability, those who obtained a ""C"" or better passed the class and are able to ""survive.""  The smartest and/or hardest working students who obtained ""A"" grades have no specific advantage over the other students with ""C"" grade in the confines of this class alone (we are leaving out GPA and future benefit and whatnot for this experiment).

Elephants can be very destructive when they encroach on to farmland and move though villages - destroying crops and sometimes killing people. Many rural communities believe the number of elephants is increasing, even though there is no evidence of this from scientific surveys.  But their ""range"" - how far the elephants travel - is expanding for a number of different reasons and that is increasing conflict between wildlife and humans. Many people believe this worsened after hunting was banned in 2013, and want it to be re-introduced.  The government has to balance lifting the hunting ban to win votes against the impact it may have on Botswana's international reputation as a luxury safari destination.

Then, I  came across [this blogpost](https://karanteckwani.com/portfolio/protein-tertiary-structure-prediction-using-its-physicochemical-properties/) in which Mr. Teckwani explains:

Huh?  I don't understand, how can something that is a measure of the  difference between two structures also be the size of a structure?

Deep learning, which is especially formidable in handling big data, has achieved great success in various fields, including bioinformatics. With the advances of the big data era in biology, it is foreseeable that deep learning will become increasingly important in the field and will be incorporated in vast majorities of analysis pipelines. In this review, we provide both the exoteric introduction of deep learning, and concrete examples and implementations of its representative applications in bioinformatics. We start from the recent achievements of deep learning in the bioinformatics field, pointing out the problems which are suitable to use deep learning. After that, we introduce deep learning in an easy-to-understand fashion, from shallow neural networks to legendary convolutional neural networks, legendary recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks, generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoder, and the most recent state-of-the-art architectures. After that, we provide eight examples, covering five bioinformatics research directions and all the four kinds of data type, with the implementation written in Tensorflow and Keras. Finally, we discuss the common issues, such as overfitting and interpretability, that users will encounter when adopting deep learning methods and provide corresponding suggestions.

As  soon  as the Czechoslovakian made this weapon, the center Eastern Europe  was  impossible to defeat, surveillance was rampant, those with the  sadness  of have heritage be so plainly impoverished and lied  to, they  were interned to hospitals for research, the coincidence  is  supremely  logical, this was to hide radiowave data zones and espionage  with  hearing their sub-vocalizations and spoken words of people. Germany  had  to assemble fast, with displacing the then current concerns of the   Dukes and Queens, and instead they industrialized and became a   confederation as protection from the East. The Freemasons learned from   Volta about the use of electricity and accordingly they helped manifest   invention on U.S. soil free in the 1790's to be moded with directed   energy devices that have espionage and modify behavior of person to   desired effect of the operator for their mission. French operators of   the radio energy grid could only communicate amongst themselves and   there was nothing but omnidirectional spreads and unreliable means to   ensure precision of delivering selection, but a separation of voices.   Early secret blueprints and schematics of the radio internal components   boards were primitive but effective, 1850's brought the frequencies   experiments on human life in Transylvania and Romania to measure   frequencies and cycles within the human brain. The race to invent a   counter measure to minds focusing in on these illegal experiments was   the research on Ephedra which they came up with Amphetamine in 1860's   and then methamphetamine in the early 1900's. Addiction is a proper way   to exhaust the desires of discovery to a plane of just being a slave   within a slave.

775,"I already submitted this post on the  [**r/askscience**](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/) subreddit, where it was reject suggesting posting it on a biology subreddit would be more fitting, so I'm here. 

Sorry if it is a stupid question, but I was curious.

The question was triggered because of my family, I'll explain:

So, my brother is the classic ginger (although his hair is more like copper tone which resembles almost brown in the winter), with pretty white and soft skin. Now, I know that that skin type is usually associated with red hair, but I have almost the exact same type of skin (but it is pretty difficult to deal with, since it can get easily irritated and I get burned in the sun), but instead of red hair, I have thick brown and curly hair with some blonde occasionally showing through (as a kid I actually had a full head of blonde locks).

That confuses the heck out of me. Why would I have the same kind of skin as my brother, without having red hair? O.o

The thing now is about our biological parents: the father had brown hair before starting to gray out, while having a red mustache and occasional red showing through his beard, and, as I've heard, he's not the only one with only a red mustache on his side of the family even though his siblings don't show that trait, nor his nephews or nieces; the mother on the other side has black hard and frizzy hair, while on her side of the family there is a whole branch of family full of redheads.

I can't wrap my head around that, how would the gene heredity most likely work in those cases? Because I can't understand why only a single part, like the beard would show red hair, while the rest is brown.",How would the heredity of red hair work? And would it be possible to be only a partial redhead or have other traits associated with red hair without having red hair at all?

783,"I'm a third year undergraduate majoring in Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology. I originally came into college thinking I was going to be a physician but decided that didn't suit me because of the time commitment. Then I decided to try the pharmacy route and have been taking all the required classes for that since last year and basically planning all my courses around fulfilling those requirements but after reading a lot about saturation and wages and hours decreasing, I'm really discouraged to continue that route. I mean, I COULD go into clinical but there's that time commitment and YEARS of schooling that I'm trying to avoid. And my parents are paying for my education so I really don't want to put that kind of burden on them knowing that I will end up in so much debt.

So I was wondering what other career paths are there for people with a BS in Bio who don't want to be a doctor of some sort or get a PhD. Like what jobs can I get right out of undergrad, what experience do I need (internships, lab work, during or after undergrad)? I know I can look this stuff up but the main things that pop up are the salaries and it's so easy to get distracted by that.

792,"Proteins, clumps, and neurodegeneration. What do these all have in common? 

Simple: Toxic protein clumps drive neurodegeneration in disorders like ALS and dementia. Researchers have known for more than a decade that a protein, called TDP-43, balls up into toxic globs, which damage brain function. But what causes these toxic protein balls to form? And how can scientists prevent them?

[A new study](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(19)30075-3?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0896627319300753%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) published in the journal *Neuron* establishes the missing link (or rather, that TDP-43 protein clumps are actually *missing* a link). Proteins need to lock onto DNA's cousin, the single-stranded RNA, to function normally. The new finding shows that TDP-43 clumped together when there was no RNA present to lock onto.

The researchers' first step was to recreate the disease in a dish, study author and University of Pittsburg neurobiologist Christopher J. Donnelly, says. By genetically modifying TDP-43 with a photoreceptor from mustard seeds, which react well to light, the researchers used blue light pulses to recreate TDP-43 clumps. 

Then, the team noted where TDP-43 tends to be found: not in the cell's nucleus (where there's a lot of RNA), but in the cytoplasm, which generally contains very little RNA. The researchers then encountered an unexpected discovery. Clumped together TDP-34 had had no RNA to attach to.

By uncovering missing RNA partners in balled-up TDP-43, the researchers were able to propose a potential treatment to prevent toxic clump formation: oligonucleotides, or synthetic versions of RNA. They found that using oligonucleotides to ""bait"" TDP-43 in live cells stopped them from attaching to each other, ultimately preventing the cells from dying.

[The big takeaway?](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/protein-clumping-drives-als-and-dementia-new-method-could-prevent-it/) 

This finding, the researchers say, holds potential in treating protein toxicity not only in ALS and dementia, but also in other neurodegenerative disorders, like Alzheimer's.","Scientists developed a method of “baiting” a protein that otherwise balls up into toxic clumps, which damage brain function"

801,"I fell into this rabbit hole at a pretty young age. I spent the majority of my childhood outside and in the lake that was right out my door. I was raised to treat that environment with the utmost respect. Naturally though, I developed a curiosity about how the water stayed fresh, the fish survived through winter, how algae grew, etc. My poor parents were stuck trying to answer my million questions lol.

Preteens hit, I focused a lot less on the outdoors. I got extremely sick when I was 12. I became hooked on learning what caused me to get so sick. 7th grade hit, then we learned genetics. I was totally hooked and wanted to study biology as a career. From the time I was 12 all the way to 17, I was convinced I'd become a molecular biologist.

Then senior year rolled around and I began doing more in-depth research on what life looks like for a person who got a BS or MS in bio. It scared me to death. I'm going to be looking at a hefty loan after college, in range od 30,000 (in state tuition in my state is INSANE even at public schools. 17,000 is not an unusual price here for an in stater.), I will probably live alone since I have never had a close friend in my life, and pay all my own bills. Life as a lab tech just does not seem financially possible. Rent in my state would easily be a week's salary, my loan repayment would be another week, basic bills would be another week, and the rest would be food and basic expenses. If my car needed a repair, I might not be able to afford food. I based my numbers off of making $15 an hour, 40 hours a week, and 50 weeks a year. 

So I decided to try Biosystems engineering. Calculus and physics were never that hard for me in high school. I picked a very good in state school with an ABET accredited biological engineering program, 90% placement rate for the bioengineering kids, and average starting salaries around 60k. Within a month, I absolutely hated the program. It did not seem like the science behind why your bioretention faciliy works mattered, they only cared about base AP level bio. I  began talking with more and more alumni and by October I realized I'd never go into the engineering industry. Industry jobs sounded very boring and I talked to over 30 BE alumni. I also really did not want to touch the business side of engineering. So I began talking to advisors in new majors, engineering career counselors, and professors. All of which told me I'd be pretty let down by engineering if I kept going, 

I then really thought long and hard. I decided that I was more passionate about bio then chemistry, so I picked Microbiology as my new major. This has been fine so far and I have pushed my boundaries in unimagineable ways. I have zn independent study in a water testing microbial lab, where I get to work 1 on 1 with a post doc and world renowed water scientist. That's like my childhood dream right there. In my bio lab, we are conducting a research project on phage diversity in a river near a dairy farm. Insanely cool as well. I've actually been in Micro longer than BE now. 

I like working with  my hands, being physically active, and mentally engaged. I have tried so hard to learn coding, but I just can't do it. I know they say its bad to give up, but I have busted butt all semester trying to code in R for my stats class. I spend hours of my time struggling and I can never get through any of it alone. When I go to the help rooms, every kid just gets sick of trying to explain why to me and just snatches the computer. The class average is an 88. I have a 72 because of the coding struggles. I cannot spend my life coding and I don't really like stats either. I don't have any desire to go into medicine and being at this land grant school makes me feel like I am more agriculture/natres based. I like economics and politics, but business does not interest me, i do NOT want to be tne bio grad who works in marketing. I am also very robotic and not very charismatic, don't think sales would work either.

I’ve been a lurker for a while, and appreciate all the previous posts and commenters on this topic which becomes kind of redundant. 

I have a degree in Biology and later obtained a degree in Medical Laboratory Science. I hated the clinical lab because it was monotonous. As of now I work in virology research at Hopkins. These skills I am learning are definitely new to me and I would like to use these skills to advance elsewhere. So far I’ve been doing a lot of cell culture, cell lysis, titrations, still learning PCR, and RNA extraction. I am very indecisive when it comes to which M.S. degree I’d like to obtain therefore I’ve been trying to gain as much workplace experience before the big investment.  

Could anyone suggest different routes to take, i’d like to stay busy and engaged and be able to move into different positions. I get bored easily. By the way I’ve been in the clinical lab for 5 yrs and research almost 6 months.

&amp;#x200B;

First, *it's a real thing*. It's NOT ""tighten the stomach muscles"" or ""shift gaze and"" or ""think about ..."". Instead it's an internal physical trigger to the sympathetic nervous system (I assume) and an adrenaline spike which causes the blood pressure and heart rate to elevate dramatically, and the pupils to dilate quickly. It doesn't require imagination or setup - one just does it. Accessing it is kind of like tightening a muscle or wiggling one's ears (but it's not a muscle).

&amp;#x200B;

It has the *physical* sensation of fear - that sudden rush if someone jumps out of a bush and goes ""BOO!!"". But it's devoid of emotional content and slower-moving - and can be turned on and halted at will. It does take a bit of focus to maintain, and quickly gets tiring and very slightly nauseating to keep it up for very long. But it's very easy to ""find""

&amp;#x200B;

When I was a teen I once did this while my doctor was taking my blood pressure. He nearly called an ambulance on the spot - it's NOT a subtle effect.

&amp;#x200B;

I later demoed this to an endocrinologist. He was intrigued but said ""nobody does that kind of research anymore - it's all *in vitro* and genetics"". Hyperbole I'm sure, but still.

&amp;#x200B;

Incidentally I've discovered it's quite handy for sobering up. A few minutes of doing this 'forcibly' and I'm much less tipsy.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm wondering if there has ever been actual research on this other than ""my cat can do this"". Does anyone know what exactly is ""triggered"" here? It's pretty obviously the sympathetic nervous system and adrenaline - but HOW? Is it actually some other gland stimulating the adrenals, or a nerve firing somewhere? Has any actual scientist or medical person looked into this?

867,"I'm not doing a masters degree currently but I'm in my 7th semester for my bachelores degree and far from finished. It would take me atleast 2.5 years from now to finish it. 

So I decided to quit. Bachelors is pretty much useless I think so it would be another 2 years for my masters degree, so 4.5 years until I hold something remotely decent in my hands.

To be clear I like biology, that is not the problem. So maybe I shouldn't quit. But I don't even know what the future looks like. What can I even do with a masters degree should I get it? I know I should know what happens next but I really don't know shit.

My impression is that even with a masters degree pretty much only academia is an option and that it is hard and long work. I don't care that much about money but I feel like I'm definitely not a hard worker that dedicates their life to the profession.

If any europeans or germans could offer insight that would be most helpful as I can imagine the situation to be very different between the US and europe.

Edit: I think what I gather from this is that indeed with a bachelors you probably at best get a job as a lab technician and that there are more opportunities with a masters. I have the feeling that people who get jobs in the industry with a masters usually are the really ambitious and engaged type though. Most positive things are that you can climb up more or figure out later what you want to do. ",If I finish a masters degree in biology in a average or below average manner what can I do next?

I have been struggling so much with this class and I seriously need help.
This class has 3 professors and 4 exams, and the professors change after every exam so theres practically no way of knowing the pattern of the exam and thus on what to study for. No practice questions are given in the class. Because all professors are new to teaching this course (genetics), theres no previous exams available. I looked online to look for some practice but this class only briefly covers the mechanisms and mostly focus on case studies (like journal articles) that applies those concepts, so theres no online practice materials that pertain to the class. The mechanisms are also upper level so theres not much practice test other than very basic ones, which aren't helpful. Problems on the back of the chapter on the textbook are all free response questions with no answer solutions, while the class exam is all multiple choice based. They also require knowledge that the book covers but the lectures don't so they are not helpful either. No studies guides are given.

The last professor's exam was very tricky; if you miss a miniscule detail that you though would not come up on an exam, you get an application question that requires that knowledge wrong.

So I have been transcribing everything the professor says and have been rewriting my notes  everyday. To prepare for application questions,  I have beencomingth my own questions. But as I come up with my own questions, I get confused on what-if's that the lecture nor the textbook does not explicitly covers, and finding the answers to those question online are very time consuming.

The rewriting is also very time consuming, as I basically write all lectures that has been covered from memory and compare it to the notes to see what I have missed, everyday. Because I transcribe my notes, theres a ton of information and I always miss something, even though I do this everyday.

This whole process leaves me to study for this course at least for 5 hours everyday this whome semester, and much more on weekends. I basically have no free time and would like to spend some time improving other areas or investing  in extracurricular activities. I am beginning to think I am wasting too much time but I don't know what to change because I am worried that I will fail the exam and ruin my GPA.

Is this typical of college bio course? Theres no curve, no study guides, no practice materials to efficiently self-assess my knowledge. I never know if I am prepared enough and cannot stop studying.

I'm thinking of taking an intro to biology class at a community college (US).  I'm a 56 y.o. male, a c.c. teacher myself, whose background is in the arts and education.  

**What is the content of an introductory biology course?** I've looked around at syllabi, some open source textbooks, etc.  but am not sure what the core is. There seem to be a lot different topics.  I'm assuming there are going to be differences from one school to the next, but there must be some basics that every course covers. I do plan on getting a hold of the syllabus for the specific course before I decide, so that will help,  I suppose.

**What are the difficulties that non-science majors face in this course?**  Is there demanding math/computations?  Is there much rote memorization?  Is there difficulty with learning about the physical world that you can't readily visualize (e.g. atoms)? Prerequisite knowledge?

**Would an intensive, online version during the summer be an option?** The course is offered in different formats.  I was thinking of taking it in the Fall in a full-semester F2F course.  I do well F2F.   It's also offered this summer in an intensive 5-week format online and F2F.  Though it is intensive, the advantage would be that I would be able to focus all my attention on it because I'll only be teaching a low-level morning class and will have really the rest of the day and weekends to put into the class.  Really, just about all my time during the 5 weeks could be devoted to the class.  I'm a good student. :) Taking the full-semester version F2F would mean having my boatload of teaching and administrative duties to take care of at the same time. That can be tough as I've seen when I took other classes.    I have no problems with the technology piece of taking tests online, using online materials, etc.  

**Is interest enough?**  Finally, I DO have interest in the ""hard"" sciences, but I haven't had a lot of experiences with them over the last 30 + years.  :)  I'm just not sure I have ""the mind"" if that makes sense.  Even when I advise my own students, I can tell that there is often a gray area between their interests and their innate skill toward certain subjects.  I'm not expecting to become a biologist. I just want to get the fundamental concepts of the biology. And, this could be a required piece in later life plans, so I would like the credits.

He said that the methods to test for DNA matches are ""subjective"": in what sense is that? Is he referring to the technical manipulations in lab (unlikely - wouldn't there be a protocol?), is he talking about the statistical methods (I assume matches are tested via standard ttest methods, wherein the alpha is subjective, but, like, not in a this-is-baloney way), or is traditional DNA testing a pretty standard procedure and he's just talking about measurement error etc?

Some of the research teams use animal and microbial models to observe how symbioses may have evolved in the first place. Examples of the large eukaryotes and their inhabited structures are sea sponges, scent glands in tree frogs, fish gills, tree roots, human gut, aquatic ciliates, salamander embryos, kleptoplasty in sea slugs etc. I’m more interested in aquatic eukaryotes, but I’m not afraid to find research that would support my argument in terrestrial symbiosis as well.

941,"So I tried engineering for a couple of months and I really hated it. Looking back, the reason that I picked it was because of how poor the job prospects in biology are. There was nothing remotely positive about my experience there. I did not find the advanced projects interesting, could care less about the technological aspects, and found the careers mind numbingly boring. 

That in mind, I switched to microbiology/genetics. I don't hate the content I am learning anymore, which is great, but it is a little under-stimulating still. (I'm in all lower division, weeder courses. I've learned all of this content in high school before, so it excited me the first three times, now I am like okay lets move on.) What worries me is what will the future look like for me? I am stuck in a position where I will have to take out around 50,000 in loans to cover my schooling. A bachelors in biology will not sustain that kind of debt. Additionally, I looked up entry level jobs for my state and most of them were $12-13 dollars with an occasional 15 thrown in there. My job now pays 11. 

Additionally, I love science, but I don't want to dedicate my life to this. I want to be able to own a boat, travel, and have a life outside of work. I'm not really interested in having a family, but I'd like autonomy over my life. It doesn't seem like a bachelors in bio gives you this kind of life.

I don't want to have any contact with patients/treating people, it doesn't remotely interest me at all. Medical school/PA/pre-professional is off the table completely. I could go into the food/fisheries/environmental sector and probably be satisfied. I'd love to avoid grad school if I could, but I'd settle for a masters I guess. My school does have an MLS major, but after learning more about it, I don't think it's a path for me. 

I am also AWFUL with computers and technology. I have taken probably 3 or 4 CS classes in my day and failed all 3 of them. Math or physics don't scare me, but they aren't things I want to turn into a career. I'm very bad with stats, but can handle calculus. 

I'm not one of those people who's hooked on the idea of field work or being outside, but I could never work a job at a desk for a living. I work a desk job now and I want to pull my hair out everyday. I think about quitting every shift.

***Original post:***

Tonight while viewing my blood for the first time since I began these experiments something very informative occurred. All that I had been theorizing and shouting had been correct. Here is my blood almost entirely in apoptosis. As theorized, this was a result of many months of consistent magnetic interference. The fields themselves act as waves; or you could think of two fields as two bubbles/balloons pressing against one another. If you do this long enough and at the right frequency you can ensure the cells conform to what is needed. This is expected to lead to cancer dispersals, polarization techniques and ultimately growth and nervous system aid.

At this stage I will be halting all further experiments to monitor how these changes decay into renormalized systems. As I feel there are significant changes I will begin again to adjust them and see if any body manipulations through the recycling of these cells is possible upon cell death or via pointing to specific locations.

Many things I have posted in the past were widely rejected and in some cases ridiculed. As a result I will not be responding to any non question comments here.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are images of my blood. This is incredibly important as it proves cells can in fact be influenced appropriately by magnetic fields and current.

There's a million items like this one, it's basically a battery, a timer, a housing, and some sort of bulb that glows blue.

I'd like to use it to kill sterilize my bathroom, especially things like toothbrushes, waterpiks, soap, loofahs, sponges, brushes, and bathtub etc.

I'd like it to kill

+ bacteria
+ fungus
+ mold
+ viruses

It would be great if I could prove it worked on any of bacteria, fungus, or mold -- I'd probably accept proof that it effectively killed one of those as proof the lamp was what it is claimed to be and not just a neon tube that glows blue.

Or if there was some other way to cheaply and relatively quickly just show it put out the right amount of UV.

So is there a cheap and easy way

+ easy way to grow a culture that I can then sterilize with the lamp without my having to dig up a petri dish and agar
+ rent a UV detector

I guess I could purchase this

What I would like to do I guess is remove the head &gt; mount an adaptor to the mic &gt; connect camera &gt; run camera to monitor for display. Is this possible?

I'll try to make it short as english isn't my first language.

After around 15 minutes or so I started to develop severe stomach cramp-like pains that would last for 30-60 seconds and that felt as if acid was destroying my stomach. I'm not really overexaggerating, the pain was pretty bad. That kept going on for probably 20 minutes every 2-3 minutes or so. I stood in front of the toilet cause I had the feeling that I had to vomit but I couldn't. I burped a lot and the burps smelled like sour/ acidlike sulfur, really aggressive smell. I know NAC contains Sulphur... After that time it kinda faded.. When I ate something 2 hours later the pain became very aggressive again, after every swallow, this time a severe short timed cramp in my stomach , maybe even esophagus, can't really tell..

Anyways, I am worried, it is now 8 hours later and my stomach still slightly hurts and feels kind of""inflammated"". What I should maybe add that 2 days ago I had a light stabbing sensation in my stomach/back the whole day but that faded. Could it be a stomach ulcer? If so, why did the NAC had that severe reaction on me? (It must have been the NAC, because the strong smell of my burps) One last thing: I kinda tend to have that reaction, when you swallow down a supplement, let'say my Maca, there is this lumpy sensations afterwards in my stomach and a few minutes later my burps have that intense smell of the supplement I ingested as it was in the case of NAC.

I am at the second year of my master's course in Applied and Experimental Biology, and I recently joined a research lab in a hospital to prepare my graduation thesis. This is my first time working in a research lab, and most important it is the first time splitting my life between working and studying. Fortunately there are no classes left to attend, but I have four exams left to do. I will be working in the lab at least until april 2020, when I plan to graduate.

Right now I'm just working 3 times a day, but since next week I will be working full time monday-friday from 9 to 6, and since they are not very eager to give me free days to study, I fear I will not be able to stick to my plan to graduate in april next year if I cannot study properly.

Fact is that as much as I like being in the lab, I really find the work to be challenging and draining and I fear that doing that every day non-stop will hinder my ability to study properly and to stick to my plan to graduate in april next year. I also fear that in the upcoming year my days will just be packed with lab work and studying, without any time left for social life or any other hobby I like. Silly at it may sound, since I always enjoyed reading, playing the guitar and excercising to keep me healthy both phisically and mentally, the idea of losing almost 50 hours in my weeks is just terrifying.

I would appreciate to know if some of you found himself in a similar situation in his master's and how you were able to deal with it, and I would also appreciate opinions on how I could pull the best out of the lab work, avoiding it to become an overwhelming and stressful experience.

The rest of the day however I didn't experience any problems, while she still said the place she got the injection hurt. Even more then 24 hours later she still said it hurt when she would lay on it sometimes.

1068,"How do you reconcile the fact that there are multiple interdependent biological processes that seem to be impossible if they evolved independently of each other? 

For example, it is impossible for a cell to make proteins without RNA polymerase. However RNA polymerase is a protein itself that needs to made from the DNA. DNA requires RNA Polymerase and RNA polymerase requires DNA.
 
Another example: If a heart evolved before blood vessels, there would be no circulation, it would be impossible to give oxygen to other organs, all other organs would die. But if blood vessels evolved before the heart, there would be no force to propel blood. Also same with heart and lungs they both absolutely need each other to function.

Now to the person that suggests these events evolved simultaneously at a very slow gradual level and got better over time: That doesn’t make sense, a cell couldn’t survive with such primitive means early on, it needs so many mechanisms to live.

&amp;#x200B;

**B/** The reflexive arc is followed by the ***stress response*** (but of course it's not mandatory for the enablement of the stress response).

The types of stressors are separated in two big categories the ***psychosocial responses*** that require *cognitive appraisal* and the **biogenic stressors** that are *automatic* (like the effects of caffeine, drugs or extreme heat).

There are also two paths that lead to anxiety, the [**cerebral cortex path**](https://www.healthcentral.com/article/pathways-to-anxiety-the-cerebral-cortex) and the [**amygdala path**](https://www.healthcentral.com/article/pathways-to-anxiety-the-amygdala).

**Questions:**

1. Is everything that I am saying correct?
2. Does the *stress response* from *biogenic stressors* passes the *amygdala* to enable the response?
3. If (2) is true, can we draw the conclusion that *psychosocial stressors* follow the *cerebral cortex path* and the *biogenic stressors* follow the *amygdala path*?

1082,"Evolution, especially the punctuated evolution of entire organ systems, seems to occur much faster than random chance would allow. Although the theory of complex self-organizing systems may provide part of the answer, I believe there is another possibility: intra-genomic gaming.

DNA is, in a way, a model of the physical world since its instruction set must allow an organism to survive in the world. But as a model it can also be seen as a ""gaming"" environment. Genes could game with each other, intra-genomically, in creating nascent organic systems - with the system matching the real-world constraints of the gaming environment being the winner. This would then be expressed as the birth of a mutation - but by intra-genomic gaming rather than just mutation due to radiation or chance. Since the genome could ""evolve"" in this way at a much greater speed than in the physical world, we explain why the speed of evolution is so much greater than can be allowed purely by random mutation.

The mutation would then, of course, be subject to natural selection, depending on its viability. We are not throwing out the very well proven theory of natural selection, just accounting for it having a speed greater than can be explained by chance. This concept must of course be verified in the lab, but I feel it has a good chance of being true. ",intra-genomic gaming

1128,"**Intro:**

I recently graduated (debt free) from an Honor's BSc in biology with a minor in statistics. I managed to get above average grades and research experience (2 published papers). I've followed the natural progression from here (without much thought) and I've been accepted to a Master's program in genomics/synthetic biology in a well known lab (**starting this May**). For the past few months I've got a head start on lab work and I've begun getting interesting results. 

**Problem:**

1. The postdoc I am working with is a control freak, micromanages my work, and criticizes details of what I do that are essentially personal preference, which I think will be increasingly  annoying over the course of my master's (I had more independence doing research as an undergrad). However, he/she is very smart and their help will undoubtedly increase my productivity. Also, I do not feel like the general environment of this lab is bringing out my full potential, and I am rarely excited and stimulated by my project. I also do not see myself pursuing the academic career path without going nuts, so I'm thinking of working in industry after my MSc.
2. I often find myself thinking about how interesting and fun it was learning statistics (through my minor), and how it contrasted with biology by being a widely applicable tool and a marketable skill (lol). I enjoy and miss the problem solving/puzzle aspect of statistics and think I could enjoy computer science for this reason. Thus, I have found myself looking up statistics/CS undergrad programs in my area. I also believe that I have the skills to succeed in this field (I had better grades in stats courses than stats majors), and career prospects will be much better.

I don't want to be indecisive and simply start this MSc without being certain that it's the best choice for me.

I realize that a second undergrad would require much more time and money. I would be able to complete my MSc debt free because of awards/stipend, but a second undergrad would surely require me to take on student loans.  I am increasingly thinking about the improved career prospects and how it may be better financially in the long run, and how I am not fully stimulated by my current work. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions to reddit:**

Has/does anyone here :

\-been in a similar situation? What did you choose and what was the outcome?

\-have any pointers or things to consider before committing to either direction? 

\-have insights about current and future job prospects in biotech/pharma

As I also know that the “+” from NAD+ comes from the charge of N in its structure. So when NAD+ is reduced, it receives 2 electrons (for example in the cellular respiration process). One electron neutralizes the  “+” charge of N, where does the 2nd electron go? And how come NAD+ receives a H to become NADH and spits out a H+? Am I missing something here?

Thank you guys!",NAD+ vs. NADH - redox reactions?

I’m a zoology graduate and have been hustling for a job for nearly two years since graduating but am getting no where fast. 
I think an issue might be my CV and the application process. These both are built to emphasise work experience. But I have very little actual work-work experience in the field outside of my degree. 

My goal is to work in conservation research one day but since I can’t afford to go back for a masters yet I’m aiming for a lab tech job. I’d also like to pick up an outlet for my animal science review writing hobby but the paid work has to come first. 
I feel I’m doing as much as I can right. I’m signed up for some science recruitment agencies, I write personalised cover letters and my CV emphasises my good work ethic and experience as much as possible but so far everything has been “you aren’t a right fit, soz”. It’s hard not to say ‘fuck it, I’ll retrain as something useful and go to the zoo in my down time’. 

Does anyone have any advice on displaying my science training I’ve had through my degree into my CV? 
If anyone has experienced this, I’d really love to here what helped. 

I unfortunately can’t afford to do unpaid work right now. My 40 hour paycheck goes to covering rent, utilities and food for two. I’m hoping my article reviews are enough to keep me up to date at the moment whilst I’m not in school.

The creatures live for 50 years and are able to reproduce until their mid-thirties, they're also close to our size. The creature's pregnancy time is 8 months, the birthing process takes a very short time and is almost painless, rarely lasting longer than 2 minutes.

The babies are physically weak when they come out but are not helpless, after a short time 30 minutes to an hour, the babies are able to move without problems, like a baby deer. The mother herself doesn't care for her newborn offspring, after giving birth she cleans up and then moves on, opting to leave her young in the care of the community as a whole. This creature only gives birth to one offspring at a time, with the rare occasion of twins or triplets.

The creature's growth cycle goes like this.

Year 1: Rapid physical developement (start out as barely mobile toddlers, end as roughly the same physicality of a three-year-old)

Year 2: Rapid mental development (their intelligence goes from rudimentary and animalistic to being much smarter at the end of the year)

Year 3: Same rate as year 1, the body develops further, getting closer to the adult form, the creature's equivalent of being 8 years old, is now able to be an independent and functional member of their pack and is no longer cared for by the rest of the community.

Year 4: Same rate as year 2, their intelligence increases to almost it's fullest potential
