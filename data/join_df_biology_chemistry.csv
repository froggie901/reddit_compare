   hello everyone, welcome back to week 78 of synthetic challenge!! thank you u/critzz123 and u/ezaroo1 for the great challenges! this week it's my turn to host the challenge and i'm going to try hosting more molecules for you to try, hope you'll enjoy!
   
   too easy? too hard? let me know, i'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the synthetic challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. if you have any suggestions for future molecules, i'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!
   
   thank you so much for your support and i hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!
   
   **rules**
   
   the challenge now contains three synthetic products labelled a, b, and c. feel free to attempt as many products as you like and please label which you will be attempting in your submission.
   
   you can use any commercially available starting material for the synthetic pathway.
   
   please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference the technique if it is novel. you do not have to solve the complete synthesis all in one go. if you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have done and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution.
   
   you can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or if it's too complex to explain in words.
   
   please have a look at the other submissions and offer them some constructive feedback!

"i was looking up if it would be possible to separate oxygen from co2 and i found something interesting(to me at least), so the following is an answer i found on physicsforums from 2007

""you could heat co2 over a catalyst of iron doped zeolite and hydrogen to produce water and ethylene. a nonthermal plasma applied to ethylene will generate carbon soot and recover the hydrogen. electrolysis of water gives back the extra hydrogen and produces oxygen. (hey! i didn't say it was efficient.) it might be useful to someone on mars who has endless power in the form of a nuclear reactor and plenty of co2 but not so much oxygen.""

"i'm not doing a masters degree currently but i'm in my 7th semester for my bachelores degree and far from finished. it would take me atleast 2.5 years from now to finish it. 

so i decided to quit. bachelors is pretty much useless i think so it would be another 2 years for my masters degree, so 4.5 years until i hold something remotely decent in my hands.

to be clear i like biology, that is not the problem. so maybe i shouldn't quit. but i don't even know what the future looks like. what can i even do with a masters degree should i get it? i know i should know what happens next but i really don't know shit.

my impression is that even with a masters degree pretty much only academia is an option and that it is hard and long work. i don't care that much about money but i feel like i'm definitely not a hard worker that dedicates their life to the profession.

if any europeans or germans could offer insight that would be most helpful as i can imagine the situation to be very different between the us and europe.

edit: i think what i gather from this is that indeed with a bachelors you probably at best get a job as a lab technician and that there are more opportunities with a masters. i have the feeling that people who get jobs in the industry with a masters usually are the really ambitious and engaged type though. most positive things are that you can climb up more or figure out later what you want to do.

edit: i think what i gather from this is that indeed with a bachelors you probably at best get a job as a lab technician and that there are more opportunities with a masters. i have the feeling that people who get jobs in the industry with a masters usually are the really ambitious and engaged type though. most positive things are that you can climb up more or figure out later what you want to do. if i finish a masters degree in biology in a average or below average manner what can i do next?",1

i have been struggling so much with this class and i seriously need help.
this class has 3 professors and 4 exams, and the professors change after every exam so theres practically no way of knowing the pattern of the exam and thus on what to study for. no practice questions are given in the class. because all professors are new to teaching this course (genetics), theres no previous exams available. i looked online to look for some practice but this class only briefly covers the mechanisms and mostly focus on case studies (like journal articles) that applies those concepts, so theres no online practice materials that pertain to the class. the mechanisms are also upper level so theres not much practice test other than very basic ones, which aren't helpful. problems on the back of the chapter on the textbook are all free response questions with no answer solutions, while the class exam is all multiple choice based. they also require knowledge that the book covers but the lectures don't so they are not helpful either. no studies guides are given.

the last professor's exam was very tricky; if you miss a miniscule detail that you though would not come up on an exam, you get an application question that requires that knowledge wrong.

so i have been transcribing everything the professor says and have been rewriting my notes  everyday. to prepare for application questions,  i have beencomingth my own questions. but as i come up with my own questions, i get confused on what-if's that the lecture nor the textbook does not explicitly covers, and finding the answers to those question online are very time consuming.

the rewriting is also very time consuming, as i basically write all lectures that has been covered from memory and compare it to the notes to see what i have missed, everyday. because i transcribe my notes, theres a ton of information and i always miss something, even though i do this everyday.

this whole process leaves me to study for this course at least for 5 hours everyday this whome semester, and much more on weekends. i basically have no free time and would like to spend some time improving other areas or investing  in extracurricular activities. i am beginning to think i am wasting too much time but i don't know what to change because i am worried that i will fail the exam and ruin my gpa.

"hi,

i'm thinking of taking an intro to biology class at a community college (us).  i'm a 56 y.o. male, a c.c. teacher myself, whose background is in the arts and education.  

**what is the content of an introductory biology course?** i've looked around at syllabi, some open source textbooks, etc.  but am not sure what the core is. there seem to be a lot different topics.  i'm assuming there are going to be differences from one school to the next, but there must be some basics that every course covers. i do plan on getting a hold of the syllabus for the specific course before i decide, so that will help,  i suppose.

**what are the difficulties that non-science majors face in this course?**  is there demanding math/computations?  is there much rote memorization?  is there difficulty with learning about the physical world that you can't readily visualize (e.g. atoms)? prerequisite knowledge?

**would an intensive, online version during the summer be an option?** the course is offered in different formats.  i was thinking of taking it in the fall in a full-semester f2f course.  i do well f2f.   it's also offered this summer in an intensive 5-week format online and f2f.  though it is intensive, the advantage would be that i would be able to focus all my attention on it because i'll only be teaching a low-level morning class and will have really the rest of the day and weekends to put into the class.  really, just about all my time during the 5 weeks could be devoted to the class.  i'm a good student. :) taking the full-semester version f2f would mean having my boatload of teaching and administrative duties to take care of at the same time. that can be tough as i've seen when i took other classes.    i have no problems with the technology piece of taking tests online, using online materials, etc.  

**is interest enough?**  finally, i do have interest in the ""hard"" sciences, but i haven't had a lot of experiences with them over the last 30 + years.  :)  i'm just not sure i have ""the mind"" if that makes sense.  even when i advise my own students, i can tell that there is often a gray area between their interests and their innate skill toward certain subjects.  i'm not expecting to become a biologist. i just want to get the fundamental concepts of the biology. and, this could be a required piece in later life plans, so i would like the credits.

he said that the methods to test for dna matches are ""subjective"": in what sense is that? is he referring to the technical manipulations in lab (unlikely - wouldn't there be a protocol?), is he talking about the statistical methods (i assume matches are tested via standard ttest methods, wherein the alpha is subjective, but, like, not in a this-is-baloney way), or is traditional dna testing a pretty standard procedure and he's just talking about measurement error etc?

"so i tried engineering for a couple of months and i really hated it. looking back, the reason that i picked it was because of how poor the job prospects in biology are. there was nothing remotely positive about my experience there. i did not find the advanced projects interesting, could care less about the technological aspects, and found the careers mind numbingly boring. 

that in mind, i switched to microbiology/genetics. i don't hate the content i am learning anymore, which is great, but it is a little under-stimulating still. (i'm in all lower division, weeder courses. i've learned all of this content in high school before, so it excited me the first three times, now i am like okay lets move on.) what worries me is what will the future look like for me? i am stuck in a position where i will have to take out around 50,000 in loans to cover my schooling. a bachelors in biology will not sustain that kind of debt. additionally, i looked up entry level jobs for my state and most of them were $12-13 dollars with an occasional 15 thrown in there. my job now pays 11. 

additionally, i love science, but i don't want to dedicate my life to this. i want to be able to own a boat, travel, and have a life outside of work. i'm not really interested in having a family, but i'd like autonomy over my life. it doesn't seem like a bachelors in bio gives you this kind of life.

i don't want to have any contact with patients/treating people, it doesn't remotely interest me at all. medical school/pa/pre-professional is off the table completely. i could go into the food/fisheries/environmental sector and probably be satisfied. i'd love to avoid grad school if i could, but i'd settle for a masters i guess. my school does have an mls major, but after learning more about it, i don't think it's a path for me. 

i am also awful with computers and technology. i have taken probably 3 or 4 cs classes in my day and failed all 3 of them. math or physics don't scare me, but they aren't things i want to turn into a career. i'm very bad with stats, but can handle calculus. 

i'm not one of those people who's hooked on the idea of field work or being outside, but i could never work a job at a desk for a living. i work a desk job now and i want to pull my hair out everyday. i think about quitting every shift. 

biology really is the only subject i find interesting, so i don't know what else to do.

"edit: follicles not folica lol

this may be purely anecdotal and not true for everyone. but as i’ve grown up (i’m 21m), i’ve noticed that hair around my body has developed in separate phases. first to come was arm and leg hair. then a long pause of several years before i started to develop pubic hair, this then took hold very quickly. pause another year or two, facial hair comes and develops fully quickly. followed by another pause in growth and then chest hair which rapidly took hold. it seems that the growth isn’t even and nothing happens for a couple years then suddenly bam it all kicks off in that area.

tonight while viewing my blood for the first time since i began these experiments something very informative occurred. all that i had been theorizing and shouting had been correct. here is my blood almost entirely in apoptosis. as theorized, this was a result of many months of consistent magnetic interference. the fields themselves act as waves; or you could think of two fields as two bubbles/balloons pressing against one another. if you do this long enough and at the right frequency you can ensure the cells conform to what is needed. this is expected to lead to cancer dispersals, polarization techniques and ultimately growth and nervous system aid.

at this stage i will be halting all further experiments to monitor how these changes decay into renormalized systems. as i feel there are significant changes i will begin again to adjust them and see if any body manipulations through the recycling of these cells is possible upon cell death or via pointing to specific locations.

many things i have posted in the past were widely rejected and in some cases ridiculed. as a result i will not be responding to any non question comments here.

here are images of my blood. this is incredibly important as it proves cells can in fact be influenced appropriately by magnetic fields and current.

&gt; 99% bacteria killing：uv light design and ozone synchronize working can kill germs without the use of chemicals. cleans and sanitizes air by killing bacteria, viruses, mites, mold, effectively improve living environment

there's a million items like this one, it's basically a battery, a timer, a housing, and some sort of bulb that glows blue.

i'd like to use it to kill sterilize my bathroom, especially things like toothbrushes, waterpiks, soap, loofahs, sponges, brushes, and bathtub etc.

i'd like it to kill

+ bacteria
+ fungus
+ mold
+ viruses

it would be great if i could prove it worked on any of bacteria, fungus, or mold -- i'd probably accept proof that it effectively killed one of those as proof the lamp was what it is claimed to be and not just a neon tube that glows blue.

or if there was some other way to cheaply and relatively quickly just show it put out the right amount of uv.

so is there a cheap and easy way

+ easy way to grow a culture that i can then sterilize with the lamp without my having to dig up a petri dish and agar
+ rent a uv detector

i guess i could purchase this

+ https://www.amazon.com/ez-bioresearch-bacteria-science-book/dp/b0165pqst0/

and then swab it from where would you suggest to build up bacteria or mold or fungus?

[that's $20 which is not too expensive, but is there a $10 homemade science alternative?]

is it reasonable for me to expect that the culture in a petri dish of whatever the hell is growing on it from my house, when exposed to the uv lamp, should die within a day or two?

i am at the second year of my master's course in applied and experimental biology, and i recently joined a research lab in a hospital to prepare my graduation thesis. this is my first time working in a research lab, and most important it is the first time splitting my life between working and studying. fortunately there are no classes left to attend, but i have four exams left to do. i will be working in the lab at least until april 2020, when i plan to graduate.

right now i'm just working 3 times a day, but since next week i will be working full time monday-friday from 9 to 6, and since they are not very eager to give me free days to study, i fear i will not be able to stick to my plan to graduate in april next year if i cannot study properly.

fact is that as much as i like being in the lab, i really find the work to be challenging and draining and i fear that doing that every day non-stop will hinder my ability to study properly and to stick to my plan to graduate in april next year. i also fear that in the upcoming year my days will just be packed with lab work and studying, without any time left for social life or any other hobby i like. silly at it may sound, since i always enjoyed reading, playing the guitar and excercising to keep me healthy both phisically and mentally, the idea of losing almost 50 hours in my weeks is just terrifying.

"how do you reconcile the fact that there are multiple interdependent biological processes that seem to be impossible if they evolved independently of each other? 

for example, it is impossible for a cell to make proteins without rna polymerase. however rna polymerase is a protein itself that needs to made from the dna. dna requires rna polymerase and rna polymerase requires dna.
 
another example: if a heart evolved before blood vessels, there would be no circulation, it would be impossible to give oxygen to other organs, all other organs would die. but if blood vessels evolved before the heart, there would be no force to propel blood. also same with heart and lungs they both absolutely need each other to function.

now to the person that suggests these events evolved simultaneously at a very slow gradual level and got better over time: that doesn’t make sense, a cell couldn’t survive with such primitive means early on, it needs so many mechanisms to live. a cell needs glucose, oxygen, isotonic osmolarity, chemical gradients, systems of atp production, cell replication enzymes and much.

dna is, in a way, a model of the physical world since its instruction set must allow an organism to survive in the world. but as a model it can also be seen as a ""gaming"" environment. genes could game with each other, intra-genomically, in creating nascent organic systems - with the system matching the real-world constraints of the gaming environment being the winner. this would then be expressed as the birth of a mutation - but by intra-genomic gaming rather than just mutation due to radiation or chance. since the genome could ""evolve"" in this way at a much greater speed than in the physical world, we explain why the speed of evolution is so much greater than can be allowed purely by random mutation.

the mutation would then, of course, be subject to natural selection, depending on its viability. we are not throwing out the very well proven theory of natural selection, just accounting for it having a speed greater than can be explained by chance. this concept must of course be verified in the lab, but i feel it has a good chance of being true.

"i’m an undergrad in a lab which studies many different types of nervous system-associated cells. a grad student and i have been working on identifying what we believe is a novel cell type. 

recently, i have been pushing for us to use single cell rna sequencing to characterize these cells. my pi has been pushing back on this and called this technology a “crock of shit” because mrna transcripts aren’t necessarily correlated with actual protein expression, and indeed often aren’t. 

my position is that, though these objections are valid, there must be some correlation between mrna and protein expression (with this being a central dogma of genetics/cell bio) and that we should still be able to gain useful information from this data which we can verify at the protein level once we’ve identified some interesting expression patterns.

"**intro:**

i recently graduated (debt free) from an honor's bsc in biology with a minor in statistics. i managed to get above average grades and research experience (2 published papers). i've followed the natural progression from here (without much thought) and i've been accepted to a master's program in genomics/synthetic biology in a well known lab (**starting this may**). for the past few months i've got a head start on lab work and i've begun getting interesting results. 

**problem:**

1. the postdoc i am working with is a control freak, micromanages my work, and criticizes details of what i do that are essentially personal preference, which i think will be increasingly  annoying over the course of my master's (i had more independence doing research as an undergrad). however, he/she is very smart and their help will undoubtedly increase my productivity. also, i do not feel like the general environment of this lab is bringing out my full potential, and i am rarely excited and stimulated by my project. i also do not see myself pursuing the academic career path without going nuts, so i'm thinking of working in industry after my msc.
2. i often find myself thinking about how interesting and fun it was learning statistics (through my minor), and how it contrasted with biology by being a widely applicable tool and a marketable skill (lol). i enjoy and miss the problem solving/puzzle aspect of statistics and think i could enjoy computer science for this reason. thus, i have found myself looking up statistics/cs undergrad programs in my area. i also believe that i have the skills to succeed in this field (i had better grades in stats courses than stats majors), and career prospects will be much better.

i don't want to be indecisive and simply start this msc without being certain that it's the best choice for me.

i realize that a second undergrad would require much more time and money. i would be able to complete my msc debt free because of awards/stipend, but a second undergrad would surely require me to take on student loans.  i am increasingly thinking about the improved career prospects and how it may be better financially in the long run, and how i am not fully stimulated by my current work.

"hey! sorry if this is the wrong place, i’ll take it down if it isn’t. 

i’m a zoology graduate and have been hustling for a job for nearly two years since graduating but am getting no where fast. 
i think an issue might be my cv and the application process. these both are built to emphasise work experience. but i have very little actual work-work experience in the field outside of my degree. 

my goal is to work in conservation research one day but since i can’t afford to go back for a masters yet i’m aiming for a lab tech job. i’d also like to pick up an outlet for my animal science review writing hobby but the paid work has to come first. 
i feel i’m doing as much as i can right. i’m signed up for some science recruitment agencies, i write personalised cover letters and my cv emphasises my good work ethic and experience as much as possible but so far everything has been “you aren’t a right fit, soz”. it’s hard not to say ‘fuck it, i’ll retrain as something useful and go to the zoo in my down time’. 

does anyone have any advice on displaying my science training i’ve had through my degree into my cv? 
if anyone has experienced this, i’d really love to here what helped. 

i unfortunately can’t afford to do unpaid work right now. my 40 hour paycheck goes to covering rent, utilities and food for two. i’m hoping my article reviews are enough to keep me up to date at the moment whilst i’m not in school.

the babies are physically weak when they come out but are not helpless, after a short time 30 minutes to an hour, the babies are able to move without problems, like a baby deer. the mother herself doesn't care for her newborn offspring, after giving birth she cleans up and then moves on, opting to leave her young in the care of the community as a whole. this creature only gives birth to one offspring at a time, with the rare occasion of twins or triplets.

the creature's growth cycle goes like this.

year 1: rapid physical developement (start out as barely mobile toddlers, end as roughly the same physicality of a three-year-old)

year 2: rapid mental development (their intelligence goes from rudimentary and animalistic to being much smarter at the end of the year)

year 3: same rate as year 1, the body develops further, getting closer to the adult form, the creature's equivalent of being 8 years old, is now able to be an independent and functional member of their pack and is no longer cared for by the rest of the community.

molecular cloning is one of the most popular methods for dna transformation since long. however, for determining the presence or absence of the dna insert we have to perform transformation experiments.

"i was always a bit confused as to why certain types of viruses existed,

for example, it always seemed to me like a dna virus is *superior* to a retrovirus, in that there's less machinery involved in helping the virus propagate (and thus, less chance of an error). i'm sure there's a host of factors that make this not true (e.g. speed at which the virus spreads is greater in retrovirus, rate of mutation is greater in retroviruses... etc).

but this is the kind of question that i have about many different types of viruses, when looking at them it's much harder to see ""why"" the managed to survive (as opposed to other competing viruses). which is counter-intuitive to me, since viruses are much simpler in nature (even though they are ultimately part of a more complex ecosystem), so it would seem to me that it should be pretty straight forward to figure out their advantage/disadvantage from an evolutionary perspective.

because the students are k - 4, a chunk of them don't read very well, so i'd like whoever does the ama type thing to record a video with responses. it doesn't have to be high quality, literally a webcam or selfie camera is fine. you can email me your responses and i'll put it on a website i made for the elementary school to access ([here's a link to the skeleton website](https://sites.google.com/brooksidecharter.org/careerweek/home)). if you don't want your video to be able to be accessed outside of the school, let me know and i'll make those privacy settings just that. 

last year, i did this on a whim and got *tons* of responses from various subreddits in just a couple of days, my class used the website for the rest of the year to learn more and loved that people made videos specifically for them. 

so, if you can help out, please message me and i'll give you whatever other information you need. i'll need any videos/typed responses by march 22nd so i can put the website together in time.

"hi, first post here and i’m not exactly sure if this is the right place to post, but i could use some advice.

so  i’m currently in my last semester of undergrad. i’m finishing up my  bachelors degree in bioinformatics but i’m completely at a loss as to  what to do with it.

my program is  structured in that i’m essentially a biology major with a cs minor, but i  realized it’s not very helpful. i originally chose this path because i  was premed and i was fascinated with programming and what it could do.

however,  over time i’ve become jaded, as i struggled with the weedout premed  courses of my major (biochem, organic chem, physics) and became  disillusioned with the general premed culture (the toxicity is huge, and  i’m not a fan of cramming info only to regurgitate it for an exam and  then forget about it all right after).

i  was planning on switching halfway through my junior year to something more practical, like cs or stats, but decided  against it due to time and money constraints, as  at that point i’ve  already finished practically 80% of the curriculum.

i  honestly wish i switched then and there, as my gpa isn’t so hot, its in the sub 3.0 range, about somwhere between 2.8 - 2.9, and i'm not taking many classes this semester, so i don't think i'll be able to raise it to a 3.0, so i don’t think grad school is an option anymore. it sucks because i've considered getting an ms in something tech or analytics related, but now i don't even have this option.

i have some  knowledge of stats and programming, but its mostly linked towards data  parsing and visualization, so i mainly work with perl, bash, sql, and  some r, but i still have much to learn compared to the average cs major, so i feel like a jack of all trades, but a master of none.

i don’t have much research  experience, only having about 1 years worth of doing mostly wet lab benchwork, so no  data analytics here.  any internships i do have are not science related at all, being in the sociopolitical field.

how  should i approach the job search? as this is the part i find most  daunting. i like research but i can’t see myself doing that as a career,  as i’m kind of sick of academia, especially anything biochem related  and i feel that everything is going to become automated soon, so less lab jobs. 

sorry for  the long post but i’m just feeling really lost and anxious as  graduations right around the corner and i’m trying to find a job, but i  feel so under-qualified  for any position i come across, anything bioinformatics or research related wants 3-5 years of experience and an ms. i’d really just  like some advice on how to best approach my situation.",feeling lost... could use some advice.,"hi, first post here and i’m not exactly sure if this is the right place to post, but i could use some advice.

i’m currently aiming to go to school to be a veterinarian but have lower gpa scores (a 3.4) than the desired 3.75. i love animals and science overall and really am struggling with a topic i could explore that would make me stand out to potential vet schools as well as something that would just be really fun and intriguing for me to research. i may as well choose a topic i enjoy if i’m going to be putting so much hard work and dedication into it.

anyways, point being. i’d love some unique topic ideas that i could possibly consider for my literature paper that may be related to the career i’m striving for. some examples the professor who is supervising my independent study has told me in the past students have discussed things like methods of muscle building such as if it makes a difference if you lift weights before vs. doing some other muscle building activity, etc. another student discussed the bacteria present in local untreated-water supplies and how those bacteria could play a part on our health, or bioterrorism attacks, etc etc. 

the idea for topics is broad so that we can really narrow it down to something we’re interested in but my anxiety on the topic and fears are inhibiting my thought process on coming up with a topic that i can successfully talk about but that is correlated to my potential interests.

hello,

i need some advice. i am recently finishing my phd in neuroscience and have concluded that i do not want – for ethical reasons – to work with animals anymore. i am, however, very interested in the possibility of going into computational biology/neuroscience research – hopefully to develop computational models that may one day substitute laboratory animals.

the problem is i have little to no background in computer science/programming, aside from a little html and some rudimentary python and have no idea where to start. which is why i am here: does any of you work in computational biology/neuroscience, and if so could you tell me what would be a starting point for me to work on, in terms of skills/knowledge, that could lead me to eventually go into this field?

i am aware that this is a profound career change, and one i am not expecting to make in a short amount of time, and that it will not be easy. but this is something i truly want and willing to put the effort in for.

thank you so much in advance!",need some advice about changing fields,"

"protect laboratory workers and the surrounding environment from pathogens with a biosafety cabinet (bsc). a hepa filter helps remove harmful bacteria and viruses from all exhaust air exiting the biosafety cabinet. biological safety cabinets also serve the purpose to maintain the sterility of material inside the enclosure. 90% of all biosafety cabinets installed are type a2. 

class ii cabinets provide protection to samples and the environment since harmful contaminants are removed by a hepa filter. there are five types of biosafety cabinets: type a1, type a2, type b1, type b2, and type c1. each type of cabinets requirements is outlined by nsf international standard. 

fans mounted inside the cabinet pull air around the user and into the cabinet protecting the operator. the air travels underneath the work surface and pushed to the top of the unit where it passes through hepa filters. after being filtered, sterile air is blown downward over products and material inside the enclosure to prevent contamination. depending on the type of class ii cabinet, filtered air can be exhausted through a hepa filter back into the laboratory or pulled by an exhaust fume system where it is expelled from the building. 

 maintenance and services

proper maintenance of a biosafety cabinet assures effective use of the containment device. the life span of a hepa filter will depend on the type of particles generated inside the biosafety cabinet. changing the filter can be done after the cabinet has been decontaminated or a “bag-in/bag-out” procedure. 

changing the filter should be handled by a trained person as the filter is potentially contaminated. 

monitor air flow. as the filter load increases so does the amount of work needed by the internal fan to push the same volume of air through the filter. newer cabinets measure air flow and self adjust the fan performance to ensure a steady volume of air moving through the unit.

"melatonin secretion is triggered in the evening in the absence of short wavelengths of the visible spectrum (or when they start to disappear due to their scattering in the evening). by short wavelengths i mean roughly those below 564 nm for humans, the number is species dependent. how is melatonin secretion regulated if people are in absolute darkness for prolonged periods of time e.g. like months in those famous cave experiments? i was told it is governed by the natural internal clock in all of us, and that for most people this clock has a period a bit longer or a bit shorter than 24 hours. this means that in absolute darkness, melatonin secretion would start approximately a few hours before sleep just thanks to the clock even without light? but how does the internal clock ""count"" the time in the absence of light and it's different spectrum during the daytime and evening? i was told that gene expression governs the clock, but this poses the same question - how do genes display periodicity of transcription and translation without the cue of light?

"i’ll write out what i know so anyone can tell me if i have a flawed understanding of something/am missing info

i’ve learned that in order for myosin to bind to actin and cause contraction, it needs to have a molecule of atp which is then hydrolyzed into adp + phosphate ion, putting it into a higher energy conformation that primes it to bind with actin. when the tropomyosin moves out of the way and allows the myosin and actin to bind, it uses the energy from the hydrolysis reaction to slide the filaments along each other and hold them rigid. then the myosin lets go of its adp + phosphate and another atp takes its place, making the myosin unbind with actin to repeat the process.

my questions are:

what determines the length of time that actin and myosin can stay connected? i have a limited understanding of physics, but wouldn’t it cost more energy to keep them bound and rigid for longer? if they only release after another atp molecule makes its way to the myosin, what happens in the absence of atp?

" i'm fairly new to tissue cultures (3-4 months of working at them), and i've been culturing hek293 cells in 10 cm plates and splitting them off into 6-well plates, and more 10 cm plates. my pi recently told me to take my exisiting 10 cm plates and split them into 15 cm plates, in which i did.

&amp;#x200b;

now i have these 15 cm plates, and this is where my confusion begins...

&amp;#x200b;

**problem**: i was told i have to do some math regarding the surface areas of the 15 cm plate and 6-well plates as a means to determine how much cells i need to add to each well to get a nice even distribution. i was told to split my 15 cm plate into 6-well plates in a 1:3 ratio (not sure what this means...); ***i need to make at least four or five 6-well plates for transfections***.

&amp;#x200b;

i did some math, but i'm not sure if i'm doing it correctly :

\[15 cm surface area (cm\^2)\]/\[6-well plate surface area (cm\^2)\] = (176.71 cm\^2)/(9.62 cm\^2) = 18.369 = approx. 18 fold concentration of cells?

(used this source to help determine my answer; it's in the comment section: [https://www.benchfly.com/video/53/calculating-how-to-split-cells/](https://www.benchfly.com/video/53/calculating-how-to-split-cells/))

&amp;#x200b;

so based on this, does this mean i have to take 1/18 of the cells from the 15 cm plate and add them into each well of a 6-well plate? how would i actually do this? like:

\- how much trypsin should i use to coat the entire 15 cm plate?

\- how much pbs (wash) should i then use to wash my cells?

\- at this point, i'll have whatever amount of trypsin and pbs, and i'd have spun it down to get a pellet. after aspirating the supernatent, how much dmem media should i use to resuspend the pellet?

\[15 cm surface area (cm\^2)\]/\[6-well plate surface area (cm\^2)\] = (176.71 cm\^2)/(9.62 cm\^2) = 18.369 = approx. 18 fold concentration of cells?

(used this source to help determine my answer; it's in the comment section: [https://www.benchfly.com/video/53/calculating-how-to-split-cells/](https://www.benchfly.com/video/53/calculating-how-to-split-cells/))

&amp;#x200b;

so based on this, does this mean i have to take 1/18 of the cells from the 15 cm plate and add them into each well of a 6-well plate? how would i actually do this? like:

\- how much trypsin should i use to coat the entire 15 cm plate?

\- how much pbs (wash) should i then use to wash my cells?

\- at this point, i'll have whatever amount of trypsin and pbs, and i'd have spun it down to get a pellet. after aspirating the supernatent, how much dmem media should i use to resuspend the pellet?

&amp;#x200b;

i'm studying to be a nurse (taking the pre reqs) so i am taking biology atm, i'm half way done with the class and i'm having problems with my exams. i currently have an 83 on the class. i have aced all my lab quizzes and lecture quizzes, got an 86 on my lab practicle and of course do all my homework.

i feel like i study alot for this class but on every exam so far (2 exams so far) i've gotten a 76 and a 74 on it. maybe i'm studying wrong? i read the chapter and take notes, i voice record the class and write the notes my teacher gives us on the power point slides. on my first exam i thought, maybe i didn't study enough so for the 2nd exam i studied alot and only got a 74. so it has to be that i'm not studying right or something. i go to a study group where we ask each other questions and stuff and i 97% of the time know the answers.

i find the questions on the exam to be worded alot different so i get either confused by them or i panic maybe? but i'm really worried that if i don't find a new way to study/understand the chapters, i may keep getting 70's on the exams.

what can i do? i use pearson's general biology 1 book if that matters. spring break is about to end and we are on chapter 8, introduction to metabolism.

things i worry about are if i would need to observe and understand bacteria in a aquaponic system, if so, i assume that would drastically increase the price? as simply having the magnification is not enough due to the lens quality? i'm not comfortable hounding for seconds either as i simply do not have the experience to grade microscopes on location.

"hey friends of life science. i'm a lurker here, and just had a few questions because i'm scared as shit for the future, is all. 

&amp;#x200b;

today i was having a conversation with my friend who is an engineer, and he's a decade older than i am. i was telling him how stressed out i am recently for my biology class i'm retaking (foundations bio, i know, loser, gotta catch up) but its really because i'm well aware that i'm not studying nearly as much as i should. i just got back into university classes since about almost 2 years ago. in between that time i was completing my foreign language requirements for my university at the local community college for a year. now that i'm back at uni, holy shit. i forgot how much more effort is required for these classes, the weed out classes, even though it's foundations.. it is rated as a difficult course, for sure. 

&amp;#x200b;

anyway... i was talking with him about what i want to do, or don't know what i want to do with biology. he basically made it seem like a biology degree is low paying jobs and not much out there unless i continue education and such; just kind of got me a little more worried about the future of my career. i took 3 years at indiana state, transferred to university of iowa due to out of state tuition rates, and different state rules to gain state residency for cheaper school, did language requirements/one class a semester/ work 30h a week etc. i basically have to do that over again as they said they didn't even receive all the information they needed, and that i wasn't at all aware that they limit the credit hours to 4 in the summer, and 6 the rest of the academic year, which is absurd in my opinion. as i was finishing up spanish, i took my last 2 spanish courses in the summer totaling 8 credit hours, and they said that basically fucked me for my residency, so i may be able to re do half of it, since i was taking 6h and working last fall, which could count. 

&amp;#x200b;

anyway, i am now in my 5th year of college, and have to pay my own way ($1,800/4credit hours) a semester, and if i take one more credit hour, i kid you not the price goes up at least $5,000. so i have to take one class/semester. also, everyone is on a different timeline, so im just going to finish up what i have left here and see where i can go. i have always loved biology. i grew up with an obgyn for a mother, which is a blessing, and just have always asked questions about science/how to get better from being sick, bla bla bla. so i've always been science oriented. i just don't really know what i want still; i'm confident i'll find something, in due time, which is why i chose biology as a broad degree as it can give me a myriad of careers to choose from. i am just asking what careers are out there that require a biology degree. i just received my aa in december, so there's something, i guess. but i don't know guys, i'm just stressin out over my study habits, academic ethic, and if i'm really even cut out for this shit. i'm just looking for any guidance, advice and tips on looking for careers in biology. sure, i'll probably be able to get a shitty ""starter"" job out of college to survive on for a few years, but i'm asking anyone who has a biology degree, or what options are out there. i'm going to stop now as i could tell you my life story if i haven't already, but i am just a little lost as it is hard to take it one day at a time by looking at everything including the future into perspective. any feedback is appreciated. thanks for reading, go science!",is biology a trash career?!,"hey friends of life science. i'm a lurker here, and just had a few questions because i'm scared as shit for the future, is all.

worldwide, over 80 plant species are known to cause poisoning from nitrate accumulation. but droughts are exacerbating this for many staple crops. even after a drought, the growth in water-stressed crops can result in the build-up of other toxins. global warming is also helping to spread mycotoxins, with 25 per cent of cereals worldwide estimated to be contaminated and 4.5 billion people exposed to uncontrolled levels. we will need an aggressive strategy to ensure the safety of agricultural yields and food in the future especially in drought- prone and even temperate zones.

"in the nested pcr, the specificity of the pcr reaction is enhanced by reducing the non-specific binding with the help of the two sets of primer. the specificity is the main aim of any of the pcr reaction. every pcr modifications are mean to increase the specificity as well as the sensitivity of the reaction. 

two sets of primers are used to achieve high sensitivity in the pcr. here, in the nested pcr, our template dna is the primary binding site for the outer set of primers while the amplicon of the first set of the pcr is the site for binding for the inner set of primers. read more on nested pcr: [**what is nested pcr?**](http://geneticeducation.co.in/what-is-nested-pcr/)

i'm seeing that most schools want to see a year of calculus, between one year to a quarter of physics, one year of gen chem, and a quarter of organic chemistry. 

my passion is environmental science, and specifically freshwater ecology. 

main questions are:

\-should i worry about organic or inorganic chemistry?

\-would a full year of physics be worth pursuing?

\-should i prioritize classes that offer research experience over more advanced classes?

\-freshwater ecology spans ecology, biology, and chemistry. what might be a good masters to pursue?

"anatomically modern humans have been around for hundreds of thousands of years, and ""civilization"" to the best of our knowledge, has only been around for at most 10,000 of those years. why is it then, that we believe humans need to shower frequently at risk of turning into smelly oily beasts, prone to infection? surely we would not have evolved this way, and through most of human history, it would seem that frequent washing was either not done or simply not possible. i have always been perplexed by this, and haven't used soap or shampoo for years without telling anybody. i have never once been told i smell bad, even after i had just gotten back from a run, drenched in sweat (my sweat doesn't really have a smell), and i have even gotten complements from girls asking what my hair routine was (i have long wavy hair and am a guy). recently i have started to just stop rising myself off in the shower all together, mostly because having a full head of thick wet hair in the dead of winter is a bit of a drag, and i have noticed literally zero side effects. when most people in western society don't shower for a few days, they get irritated, oily skin and hair, and tend to develop a foul odor, am i some sort of genetic anomaly? i don't think so, i think that constantly washing off the natural oils and  bacteria causes your body to overproduce those things to compensate. the thing that really gets me thinking, is that there is next to zero research or discussion about this topic, with most people just writing me off as a gross basement dweller. have any of you guys come across any academic discussion or research on this, or have any other thoughts to share?",do we really need to shower?,"anatomically modern humans have been around for hundreds of thousands of years, and ""civilization"" to the best of our knowledge, has only been around for at most 10,000 of those years. why is it then, that we believe humans need to shower frequently at risk of turning into smelly oily beasts, prone to infection? surely we would not have evolved this way, and through most of human history, it would seem that frequent washing was either not done or simply not possible. i have always been perplexed by this, and haven't used soap or shampoo for years without telling anybody. i have never once been told i smell bad, even after i had just gotten back from a run, drenched in sweat (my sweat doesn't really have a smell), and i have even gotten complements from girls asking what my hair routine was (i have long wavy hair and am a guy). recently i have started to just stop rising myself off in the shower all together, mostly because having a full head of thick wet hair in the dead of winter is a bit of a drag, and i have noticed literally zero side effects. when most people in western society don't shower for a few days, they get irritated, oily skin and hair, and tend to develop a foul odor, am i some sort of genetic anomaly? i don't think so, i think that constantly washing off the natural oils and  bacteria causes your body to overproduce those things to compensate. the thing that really gets me thinking, is that there is next to zero research or discussion about this topic, with most people just writing me off as a gross basement dweller. have any of you guys come across any academic discussion or research on this, or have any other thoughts to share?do we really need to shower?",1

hello friends, fellow scholars and broskis,

so i am an undergraduate bio engineer working in this cell lab.

so my pi wants us (phd and i) to publish in nature, but or paper **literally only has western blot data**. from previous experience i know that western blot data is supposed to be supplementary. but my pi does not want to spend extra money on any other method. i tried everything to convince him, even sent him nature papers saying wetern blot is not very trustworthy.

am i the asshole for doubting him as he is the authority ?

the phd im helping out is seriously stressed out to the point that she got ulcers and is depressed. i don't know what to do. i love this lab and have been a part of it since freshmen year. advice is appreciated.

thanks.",is western blot enough for publication? or is my pi insane?,"&amp;#x200b;

now, throughout the entirety of science education (in the us), students are taught evolution, natural selection, and darwinism via the phrase ""survival of the fittest."" while i know that this was the phrase that darwin likely coined to sell his theory, it is a phrase that persists to this day. in primary school i think this is a good tool to help young students understand the most basic concept of evolution. however, this phrase ""survival of the fittest"" persists at the university level even among higher level genetics and biology courses and typically treated as a truth rather than a concept. 

&amp;#x200b;

the phrase ""survival of the fittest is great of depicting or understanding survivability of an organism given a single stressor. for example, a most fit organism would be a bacteria with resistance to a particular class of antibiotics and able to survive an antibiotic course. however, i think this an unfit simplification of population genetics when speaking of survivability of a population as a whole. i argue that it would be better (at least at university level) to at least have students understand that evolution in terms of population genetics comes out in the wild as more ""survival of the average.""

i will use class grading as a ""real world"" example. lets say you're taking a class and your grade is determined by the cumlative work of homework, exams, papers, presentations. at the end of the class your grades are compiled and if you graph all of the grades, you will get a bell curve with a majority of students earning a ""c"" grade. if you break down the individual strengths of each student, you can see that some students can have better grades in some areas compared to others and/or be the best in all categories which theoretically improves or decreases the ability of each student to be ""well suited"" for this class. in terms of survivability, those who obtained a ""c"" or better passed the class and are able to ""survive.""  the smartest and/or hardest working students who obtained ""a"" grades have no specific advantage over the other students with ""c"" grade in the confines of this class alone (we are leaving out gpa and future benefit and whatnot for this experiment).

elephants can be very destructive when they encroach on to farmland and move though villages - destroying crops and sometimes killing people. many rural communities believe the number of elephants is increasing, even though there is no evidence of this from scientific surveys.  but their ""range"" - how far the elephants travel - is expanding for a number of different reasons and that is increasing conflict between wildlife and humans. many people believe this worsened after hunting was banned in 2013, and want it to be re-introduced.  the government has to balance lifting the hunting ban to win votes against the impact it may have on botswana's international reputation as a luxury safari destination.

so, my brother is the classic ginger (although his hair is more like copper tone which resembles almost brown in the winter), with pretty white and soft skin. now, i know that that skin type is usually associated with red hair, but i have almost the exact same type of skin (but it is pretty difficult to deal with, since it can get easily irritated and i get burned in the sun), but instead of red hair, i have thick brown and curly hair with some blonde occasionally showing through (as a kid i actually had a full head of blonde locks).

that confuses the heck out of me. why would i have the same kind of skin as my brother, without having red hair? o.o

the thing now is about our biological parents: the father had brown hair before starting to gray out, while having a red mustache and occasional red showing through his beard, and, as i've heard, he's not the only one with only a red mustache on his side of the family even though his siblings don't show that trait, nor his nephews or nieces; the mother on the other side has black hard and frizzy hair, while on her side of the family there is a whole branch of family full of redheads.

should i continue in a different site? or maybe i should start the ""organic chemistry"" course before i continue the biology one?

right now im in the ""macromolecules"" section (which is the 4 or 5 i think.)      
untill now it was pretty easy to understand but in this section i feel completely lost... i still solve the questions easily but i dont think i understand the stuff 100%. they are rushing some stuff, and throw tons of new terms.

"hi folks. i share a room with someone who does mammalian cell culture in a co2 incubator in the corner. sometimes the co2 will run out and the incubator will alert us and we'll change the tank. other times we may be away a few days and miss the alert and my roommate will come back to dead cells. bummer. or maybe (and this is the reason i'm posting) i come in to see the alarm going off, silence it, and then forget to tell anybody or change the tank myself. dead cells again. yikes. mortifying.

what i'd love to have would be a co2 sensor that could send out alerts via text, email, push notification, anything like that so that we can be alerted if the [co2] drops due to empty tank even if we're not in the lab. does something like this exist? i'm also eager to hear about other solutions to this problem. i feel like i might be missing something really obvious that people with a background in cell culture would see immediately. thank you in advance.

"proteins, clumps, and neurodegeneration. what do these all have in common? 

simple: toxic protein clumps drive neurodegeneration in disorders like als and dementia. researchers have known for more than a decade that a protein, called tdp-43, balls up into toxic globs, which damage brain function. but what causes these toxic protein balls to form? and how can scientists prevent them?

[a new study](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/s0896-6273(19)30075-3?_returnurl=https%3a%2f%2flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2fretrieve%2fpii%2fs0896627319300753%3fshowall%3dtrue) published in the journal *neuron* establishes the missing link (or rather, that tdp-43 protein clumps are actually *missing* a link). proteins need to lock onto dna's cousin, the single-stranded rna, to function normally. the new finding shows that tdp-43 clumped together when there was no rna present to lock onto.

the researchers' first step was to recreate the disease in a dish, study author and university of pittsburg neurobiologist christopher j. donnelly, says. by genetically modifying tdp-43 with a photoreceptor from mustard seeds, which react well to light, the researchers used blue light pulses to recreate tdp-43 clumps. 

then, the team noted where tdp-43 tends to be found: not in the cell's nucleus (where there's a lot of rna), but in the cytoplasm, which generally contains very little rna. the researchers then encountered an unexpected discovery. clumped together tdp-34 had had no rna to attach to.

by uncovering missing rna partners in balled-up tdp-43, the researchers were able to propose a potential treatment to prevent toxic clump formation: oligonucleotides, or synthetic versions of rna. they found that using oligonucleotides to ""bait"" tdp-43 in live cells stopped them from attaching to each other, ultimately preventing the cells from dying.

[the big takeaway?](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/protein-clumping-drives-als-and-dementia-new-method-could-prevent-it/)

"i fell into this rabbit hole at a pretty young age. i spent the majority of my childhood outside and in the lake that was right out my door. i was raised to treat that environment with the utmost respect. naturally though, i developed a curiosity about how the water stayed fresh, the fish survived through winter, how algae grew, etc. my poor parents were stuck trying to answer my million questions lol.

preteens hit, i focused a lot less on the outdoors. i got extremely sick when i was 12. i became hooked on learning what caused me to get so sick. 7th grade hit, then we learned genetics. i was totally hooked and wanted to study biology as a career. from the time i was 12 all the way to 17, i was convinced i'd become a molecular biologist.

then senior year rolled around and i began doing more in-depth research on what life looks like for a person who got a bs or ms in bio. it scared me to death. i'm going to be looking at a hefty loan after college, in range od 30,000 (in state tuition in my state is insane even at public schools. 17,000 is not an unusual price here for an in stater.), i will probably live alone since i have never had a close friend in my life, and pay all my own bills. life as a lab tech just does not seem financially possible. rent in my state would easily be a week's salary, my loan repayment would be another week, basic bills would be another week, and the rest would be food and basic expenses. if my car needed a repair, i might not be able to afford food. i based my numbers off of making $15 an hour, 40 hours a week, and 50 weeks a year. 

so i decided to try biosystems engineering. calculus and physics were never that hard for me in high school. i picked a very good in state school with an abet accredited biological engineering program, 90% placement rate for the bioengineering kids, and average starting salaries around 60k. within a month, i absolutely hated the program. it did not seem like the science behind why your bioretention faciliy works mattered, they only cared about base ap level bio. i  began talking with more and more alumni and by october i realized i'd never go into the engineering industry. industry jobs sounded very boring and i talked to over 30 be alumni. i also really did not want to touch the business side of engineering. so i began talking to advisors in new majors, engineering career counselors, and professors. all of which told me i'd be pretty let down by engineering if i kept going, 

i then really thought long and hard. i decided that i was more passionate about bio then chemistry, so i picked microbiology as my new major. this has been fine so far and i have pushed my boundaries in unimagineable ways. i have zn independent study in a water testing microbial lab, where i get to work 1 on 1 with a post doc and world renowed water scientist. that's like my childhood dream right there. in my bio lab, we are conducting a research project on phage diversity in a river near a dairy farm. insanely cool as well. i've actually been in micro longer than be now. 

i like working with  my hands, being physically active, and mentally engaged. i have tried so hard to learn coding, but i just can't do it. i know they say its bad to give up, but i have busted butt all semester trying to code in r for my stats class. i spend hours of my time struggling and i can never get through any of it alone. when i go to the help rooms, every kid just gets sick of trying to explain why to me and just snatches the computer. the class average is an 88. i have a 72 because of the coding struggles. i cannot spend my life coding and i don't really like stats either. i don't have any desire to go into medicine and being at this land grant school makes me feel like i am more agriculture/natres based. i like economics and politics, but business does not interest me, i do not want to be tne bio grad who works in marketing. i am also very robotic and not very charismatic, don't think sales would work either.

  this report focus on the segmentation of crispr-cas9 market by applications (academic research tools, drug development, agriculture, human clinical therapeutics, and animal and disease model). by products (editing tools, cell lines, animal models, and plant breeding products ). by regional segmentation into north america, europe, asia pacific (apac) and rest of world (row). by technology (drug compound and target screening, and agriculture and nutritional health products ) and in-depth analysis of global crispr-cas9 market, forecasts and key players is intended to aid the researchers in understanding global opportunities in this space.   

  the global market for crispr-cas9 technology was estimated at $1,220 million in 2017 which is projected to grow exponentially at a cagr of 20.19 per cent and attain a market value of $5,311 million by 2025. various market segments such as therapeutics, research tools, drug discovery and agriculture have been evaluated on the bases of emerging growth opportunities. market driving factors and constraints have been considered to estimate global crispr cas9 market potential.      
crispr-cas9 is becoming a pre-requisite tool in genome editing market. the programmable capacity of the cas9 enzyme is now transforming varied fields of medical research, industrial and animal biotechnology, and agriculture. crispr-cas9 gene editing technology is an immensely stimulating area for molecular biologists, opening a wide range of opportunities in several application areas. 

  crispr cas9 market report also covers the patent trends in detail to understand the research and development activities happening around the world over the years. it delves into licensing and litigation battles which are restricting the commercial growth of the market. this report will delve deep into the patent landscape for this disruptive technology identifying key patent assignees and inventors. it will also highlight academic and corporate collaborations, and litigation and licensing environment. 

  crispr-cas9 patent landscape is dominated by universities and research institutes over commercial companies. us and chinese academic institutions are actively pursuing research activities in crispr domain. massachusetts institute of technology (mit) holds the largest

i have a degree in biology and later obtained a degree in medical laboratory science. i hated the clinical lab because it was monotonous. as of now i work in virology research at hopkins. these skills i am learning are definitely new to me and i would like to use these skills to advance elsewhere. so far i’ve been doing a lot of cell culture, cell lysis, titrations, still learning pcr, and rna extraction. i am very indecisive when it comes to which m.s. degree i’d like to obtain therefore i’ve been trying to gain as much workplace experience before the big investment.  

could anyone suggest different routes to take, i’d like to stay busy and engaged and be able to move into different positions. i get bored easily. by the way i’ve been in the clinical lab for 5 yrs and research almost 6 months. 

thanks!laboratory career transition. help!",1

first, *it's a real thing*. it's not ""tighten the stomach muscles"" or ""shift gaze and"" or ""think about ..."". instead it's an internal physical trigger to the sympathetic nervous system (i assume) and an adrenaline spike which causes the blood pressure and heart rate to elevate dramatically, and the pupils to dilate quickly. it doesn't require imagination or setup - one just does it. accessing it is kind of like tightening a muscle or wiggling one's ears (but it's not a muscle).

&amp;#x200b;

it has the *physical* sensation of fear - that sudden rush if someone jumps out of a bush and goes ""boo!!"". but it's devoid of emotional content and slower-moving - and can be turned on and halted at will. it does take a bit of focus to maintain, and quickly gets tiring and very slightly nauseating to keep it up for very long. but it's very easy to ""find""

&amp;#x200b;

when i was a teen i once did this while my doctor was taking my blood pressure. he nearly called an ambulance on the spot - it's not a subtle effect.

&amp;#x200b;

i later demoed this to an endocrinologist. he was intrigued but said ""nobody does that kind of research anymore - it's all *in vitro* and genetics"". hyperbole i'm sure, but still.

&amp;#x200b;

incidentally i've discovered it's quite handy for sobering up. a few minutes of doing this 'forcibly' and i'm much less tipsy.

&amp;#x200b;

anyway, i'm wondering if there has ever been actual research on this other than ""my cat can do this"". does anyone know what exactly is ""triggered"" here? it's pretty obviously the sympathetic nervous system and adrenaline - but how? is it actually some other gland stimulating the adrenals, or a nerve firing somewhere? has any actual scientist or medical person looked into this?

"i'm not doing a masters degree currently but i'm in my 7th semester for my bachelores degree and far from finished. it would take me atleast 2.5 years from now to finish it. 

so i decided to quit. bachelors is pretty much useless i think so it would be another 2 years for my masters degree, so 4.5 years until i hold something remotely decent in my hands.

to be clear i like biology, that is not the problem. so maybe i shouldn't quit. but i don't even know what the future looks like. what can i even do with a masters degree should i get it? i know i should know what happens next but i really don't know shit.

my impression is that even with a masters degree pretty much only academia is an option and that it is hard and long work. i don't care that much about money but i feel like i'm definitely not a hard worker that dedicates their life to the profession.

if any europeans or germans could offer insight that would be most helpful as i can imagine the situation to be very different between the us and europe.

edit: i think what i gather from this is that indeed with a bachelors you probably at best get a job as a lab technician and that there are more opportunities with a masters. i have the feeling that people who get jobs in the industry with a masters usually are the really ambitious and engaged type though. most positive things are that you can climb up more or figure out later what you want to do.

this class has 3 professors and 4 exams, and the professors change after every exam so theres practically no way of knowing the pattern of the exam and thus on what to study for. no practice questions are given in the class. because all professors are new to teaching this course (genetics), theres no previous exams available. i looked online to look for some practice but this class only briefly covers the mechanisms and mostly focus on case studies (like journal articles) that applies those concepts, so theres no online practice materials that pertain to the class. the mechanisms are also upper level so theres not much practice test other than very basic ones, which aren't helpful. problems on the back of the chapter on the textbook are all free response questions with no answer solutions, while the class exam is all multiple choice based. they also require knowledge that the book covers but the lectures don't so they are not helpful either. no studies guides are given.

the last professor's exam was very tricky; if you miss a miniscule detail that you though would not come up on an exam, you get an application question that requires that knowledge wrong.

so i have been transcribing everything the professor says and have been rewriting my notes  everyday. to prepare for application questions,  i have beencomingth my own questions. but as i come up with my own questions, i get confused on what-if's that the lecture nor the textbook does not explicitly covers, and finding the answers to those question online are very time consuming.

the rewriting is also very time consuming, as i basically write all lectures that has been covered from memory and compare it to the notes to see what i have missed, everyday. because i transcribe my notes, theres a ton of information and i always miss something, even though i do this everyday.

this whole process leaves me to study for this course at least for 5 hours everyday this whome semester, and much more on weekends. i basically have no free time and would like to spend some time improving other areas or investing  in extracurricular activities. i am beginning to think i am wasting too much time but i don't know what to change because i am worried that i will fail the exam and ruin my gpa.

is this typical of college bio course? theres no curve, no study guides, no practice materials to efficiently self-assess my knowledge. i never know if i am prepared enough and cannot stop studying. this semester has been so frustrating because of this course. any advice on how to study more effectively for this course would be appreciated.",[x-post from r/college] how to deal with this bio class,"tl;dr - don't know what to expect for the exam, feel  like i am studying wrong, need advice on how to distinguish important details and unimportant ones from the lecture

"hi,

i'm thinking of taking an intro to biology class at a community college (us).  i'm a 56 y.o. male, a c.c. teacher myself, whose background is in the arts and education.  

**what is the content of an introductory biology course?** i've looked around at syllabi, some open source textbooks, etc.  but am not sure what the core is. there seem to be a lot different topics.  i'm assuming there are going to be differences from one school to the next, but there must be some basics that every course covers. i do plan on getting a hold of the syllabus for the specific course before i decide, so that will help,  i suppose.

**what are the difficulties that non-science majors face in this course?**  is there demanding math/computations?  is there much rote memorization?  is there difficulty with learning about the physical world that you can't readily visualize (e.g. atoms)? prerequisite knowledge?

**would an intensive, online version during the summer be an option?** the course is offered in different formats.  i was thinking of taking it in the fall in a full-semester f2f course.  i do well f2f.   it's also offered this summer in an intensive 5-week format online and f2f.  though it is intensive, the advantage would be that i would be able to focus all my attention on it because i'll only be teaching a low-level morning class and will have really the rest of the day and weekends to put into the class.  really, just about all my time during the 5 weeks could be devoted to the class.  i'm a good student. :) taking the full-semester version f2f would mean having my boatload of teaching and administrative duties to take care of at the same time. that can be tough as i've seen when i took other classes.    i have no problems with the technology piece of taking tests online, using online materials, etc.  

**is interest enough?**  finally, i do have interest in the ""hard"" sciences, but i haven't had a lot of experiences with them over the last 30 + years.  :)  i'm just not sure i have ""the mind"" if that makes sense.  even when i advise my own students, i can tell that there is often a gray area between their interests and their innate skill toward certain subjects.  i'm not expecting to become a biologist. i just want to get the fundamental concepts of the biology. and, this could be a required piece in later life plans, so i would like the credits.

"i am well aware of the whole system that is activated during the fight-or-flight response. i know that the hpa axis and the sns, are activated during this process. the later precedes the former since the signaling via electrical and chemical synapses of the nervous system is faster than endocrine signaling.

the sns system has two pathways, one that leads to activation of the adrenal medulla in order to release norepinephrine as a hormone and the other leads to the release of neurotransmitters.

&amp;#x200b;

***original post:***

tonight while viewing my blood for the first time since i began these experiments something very informative occurred. all that i had been theorizing and shouting had been correct. here is my blood almost entirely in apoptosis. as theorized, this was a result of many months of consistent magnetic interference. the fields themselves act as waves; or you could think of two fields as two bubbles/balloons pressing against one another. if you do this long enough and at the right frequency you can ensure the cells conform to what is needed. this is expected to lead to cancer dispersals, polarization techniques and ultimately growth and nervous system aid.

at this stage i will be halting all further experiments to monitor how these changes decay into renormalized systems. as i feel there are significant changes i will begin again to adjust them and see if any body manipulations through the recycling of these cells is possible upon cell death or via pointing to specific locations.

many things i have posted in the past were widely rejected and in some cases ridiculed. as a result i will not be responding to any non question comments here.

&amp;#x200b;

here are images of my blood. this is incredibly important as it proves cells can in fact be influenced appropriately by magnetic fields and current.

&amp;#x200b;

i have many theories in place, and many ideas or calculations which lead me to this result. please read through [www.arisopus.com](https://www.arisopus.com) to gather all thoughts and considerations which resulted in this.

[day 3 ](https://i.redd.it/czbzhs6r4dp21.jpg)",self programed apoptosis through use of magnetic current &amp; electricity (pictures included),"these tests were done *in vivo*

&gt;[here are the 3 day results](http://arisopus.com/biology/microscope-journal/), and i also added the images to the post  
  
&gt;  
&gt;today you can see all cells give a few stray cells are back to healthy states. you can view how the phagocytes consumed the cells which were in apoptosis on day two.

***note to anyone with access to a lab. i can't afford materials for markers and i don't start school for this until august. can you use your lab to replicate the results? i'd be happy to explain what i did to cause this.***

***this is something that will cure cancer, which is why you need to understand that you should aim to help other scientists, and not look to discredit. especially when you identify something so promising like this. we are all so desperate to solve this, and people are dying as i type this. i don't want to take 4 years to show this is correct when there are so many people with the access to equipment to do this now.***

***if there were any real experts in the field we would have already cured cancer.***

***for some reason people keep downvoting this and even removing it from forums. i am really at a loss as to the reaction i get over this, and need other scientists to listen.***

***the fact that i have done this so easily should be a huge red flag for you and cause you to investigate.***

&amp;#x200b;

***original post:***

tonight while viewing my blood for the first time since i began these experiments something very informative occurred. all that i had been theorizing and shouting had been correct. here is my blood almost entirely in apoptosis. as theorized, this was a result of many months of consistent magnetic interference. the fields themselves act as waves; or you could think of two fields as two bubbles/balloons pressing against one another. if you do this long enough and at the right frequency you can ensure the cells conform to what is needed. this is expected to lead to cancer dispersals, polarization techniques and ultimately growth and nervous system aid.

at this stage i will be halting all further experiments to monitor how these changes decay into renormalized systems. as i feel there are significant changes i will begin again to adjust them and see if any body manipulations through the recycling of these cells is possible upon cell death or via pointing to specific locations.

many things i have posted in the past were widely rejected and in some cases ridiculed. as a result i will not be responding to any non question comments here.

&amp;#x200b;

here are images of my blood. this is incredibly important as it proves cells can in fact be influenced appropriately by magnetic fields and current.

&amp;#x200b;

i have many theories in place, and many ideas or calculations which lead me to this result. please read through [www.arisopus.com](https://www.arisopus.com) to gather all thoughts and considerations which resulted in this.

&amp;#x200b;

this will continue to be updated here: [http://arisopus.com/microscope-journal/](http://arisopus.com/microscope-journal/) \- with daily monitoring of changes

there's a million items like this one, it's basically a battery, a timer, a housing, and some sort of bulb that glows blue.

i'd like to use it to kill sterilize my bathroom, especially things like toothbrushes, waterpiks, soap, loofahs, sponges, brushes, and bathtub etc.

it would be great if i could prove it worked on any of bacteria, fungus, or mold -- i'd probably accept proof that it effectively killed one of those as proof the lamp was what it is claimed to be and not just a neon tube that glows blue.

or if there was some other way to cheaply and relatively quickly just show it put out the right amount of uv.

so is there a cheap and easy way

+ easy way to grow a culture that i can then sterilize with the lamp without my having to dig up a petri dish and agar
+ rent a uv detector

i guess i could purchase this

and then swab it from where would you suggest to build up bacteria or mold or fungus?

[that's $20 which is not too expensive, but is there a $10 homemade science alternative?]

is it reasonable for me to expect that the culture in a petri dish of whatever the hell is growing on it from my house, when exposed to the uv lamp, should die within a day or two?

"hey,

i'll try to make it short as english isn't my first language. today i took 2 nac capsules from now (already taken them in the past without any issue) and probably 10 minutes before lions mane and trimethylglycine. after around 15 minutes or so i started to develop severe stomach cramp-like pains that would last for 30-60 seconds and that felt as if acid was destroying my stomach. i'm not really overexaggerating, the pain was pretty bad. that kept going on for probably 20 minutes every 2-3 minutes or so. i stood in front of the toilet cause i had the feeling that i had to vomit but i couldn't. i burped a lot and the burps smelled like sour/ acidlike sulfur, really aggressive smell. i know nac contains sulphur... after that time it kinda faded.. when i ate something 2 hours later the pain became very aggressive again, after every swallow, this time a severe short timed cramp in my stomach , maybe even esophagus, can't really tell..

anyways, i am worried, it is now 8 hours later and my stomach still slightly hurts and feels kind of""inflammated"". what i should maybe add that 2 days ago i had a light stabbing sensation in my stomach/back the whole day but that faded. could it be a stomach ulcer? if so, why did the nac had that severe reaction on me? (it must have been the nac, because the strong smell of my burps) one last thing: i kinda tend to have that reaction, when you swallow down a supplement, let'say my maca, there is this lumpy sensations afterwards in my stomach and a few minutes later my burps have that intense smell of the supplement i ingested as it was in the case of nac. what the hell happens in my stomach/oesophagus?

"hello fellow biologists and redditors. i am here to ask you an advice about my situation in university.

i am at the second year of my master's course in applied and experimental biology, and i recently joined a research lab in a hospital to prepare my graduation thesis. this is my first time working in a research lab, and most important it is the first time splitting my life between working and studying. fortunately there are no classes left to attend, but i have four exams left to do. i will be working in the lab at least until april 2020, when i plan to graduate.

right now i'm just working 3 times a day, but since next week i will be working full time monday-friday from 9 to 6, and since they are not very eager to give me free days to study, i fear i will not be able to stick to my plan to graduate in april next year if i cannot study properly.

fact is that as much as i like being in the lab, i really find the work to be challenging and draining and i fear that doing that every day non-stop will hinder my ability to study properly and to stick to my plan to graduate in april next year. i also fear that in the upcoming year my days will just be packed with lab work and studying, without any time left for social life or any other hobby i like. silly at it may sound, since i always enjoyed reading, playing the guitar and excercising to keep me healthy both phisically and mentally, the idea of losing almost 50 hours in my weeks is just terrifying.

i would appreciate to know if some of you found himself in a similar situation in his master's and how you were able to deal with it, and i would also appreciate opinions on how i could pull the best out of the lab work, avoiding it to become an overwhelming and stressful experience.

best regards to you all!

for example, it is impossible for a cell to make proteins without rna polymerase. however rna polymerase is a protein itself that needs to made from the dna. dna requires rna polymerase and rna polymerase requires dna.
 
another example: if a heart evolved before blood vessels, there would be no circulation, it would be impossible to give oxygen to other organs, all other organs would die. but if blood vessels evolved before the heart, there would be no force to propel blood. also same with heart and lungs they both absolutely need each other to function.

now to the person that suggests these events evolved simultaneously at a very slow gradual level and got better over time: that doesn’t make sense, a cell couldn’t survive with such primitive means early on, it needs so many mechanisms to live. a cell needs glucose, oxygen, isotonic osmolarity, chemical gradients, systems of atp production, cell replication enzymes and much.

i always like to lead with my knowledge limitations because i believe a large portion of online bickering is because of people jumping onto one another due to a party having a lack of knowledge. i am a 3rd-year biology student and i have been interested in understanding more about how our pollution impacts our diets and if there really is any 'safe' diet/food now.

"i’m an undergrad in a lab which studies many different types of nervous system-associated cells. a grad student and i have been working on identifying what we believe is a novel cell type.

"**intro:**

i recently graduated (debt free) from an honor's bsc in biology with a minor in statistics. i managed to get above average grades and research experience (2 published papers). i've followed the natural progression from here (without much thought) and i've been accepted to a master's program in genomics/synthetic biology in a well known lab (**starting this may**). for the past few months i've got a head start on lab work and i've begun getting interesting results. 

**problem:**

1. the postdoc i am working with is a control freak, micromanages my work, and criticizes details of what i do that are essentially personal preference, which i think will be increasingly  annoying over the course of my master's (i had more independence doing research as an undergrad). however, he/she is very smart and their help will undoubtedly increase my productivity. also, i do not feel like the general environment of this lab is bringing out my full potential, and i am rarely excited and stimulated by my project. i also do not see myself pursuing the academic career path without going nuts, so i'm thinking of working in industry after my msc.
2. i often find myself thinking about how interesting and fun it was learning statistics (through my minor), and how it contrasted with biology by being a widely applicable tool and a marketable skill (lol). i enjoy and miss the problem solving/puzzle aspect of statistics and think i could enjoy computer science for this reason. thus, i have found myself looking up statistics/cs undergrad programs in my area. i also believe that i have the skills to succeed in this field (i had better grades in stats courses than stats majors), and career prospects will be much better.

i don't want to be indecisive and simply start this msc without being certain that it's the best choice for me.

i realize that a second undergrad would require much more time and money. i would be able to complete my msc debt free because of awards/stipend, but a second undergrad would surely require me to take on student loans.  i am increasingly thinking about the improved career prospects and how it may be better financially in the long run, and how i am not fully stimulated by my current work.

year 1: rapid physical developement (start out as barely mobile toddlers, end as roughly the same physicality of a three-year-old)

"colony pcr is a rapid, high throughput pcr method to determine the presence or absence of the inserted dna into plasmid directly from the bacterial colonies.

molecular cloning is one of the most popular methods for dna transformation since long. however, for determining the presence or absence of the dna insert we have to perform transformation experiments.

colony pcr is a novel method in which by designing the inserted dna specific primers, we can identify whether our dna of interest is inserted into the plasmid or not.

"i am planning on taking cell biology this summer, and every upperclassman in my major says cell biology was like the hardest class they had to take (i'm also scared about organic chemistry which i'll be taking next fall, but i heard orgo is nothing compared to cell bio!) and i was wondering what i could do in order to prepare for the course.

&amp;#x200b;

i'm taking two other classes this summer(one normal level class, one easy course), just to receive financial aid at my university and i'll be working about 15 hours a week.

&amp;#x200b;

is there any good books(pdfs) or other resources that's really helpful for college level cell biology class?

i read about my cell biology professor on ratemyprofessors and apparently he's not very good at teaching, and my friend who got a b+ in that class said he just skipped lectures and had to teach himself.

anything helps, thank you in advance.",how to prepare for cell biology?,"i am planning on taking cell biology this summer, and every upperclassman in my major says cell biology was like the hardest class they had to take (i'm also scared about organic chemistry which i'll be taking next fall, but i heard orgo is nothing compared to cell bio!) and i was wondering what i could do in order to prepare for the course.
